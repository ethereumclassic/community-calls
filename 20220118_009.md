## Housekeeping

From now on we'll be creating a new thread for each call one week before it starts, so it's easier to contribute questions if you are in the discord. You'll be able to find thoe threads in the community-call-notes channel.

We are looking for volunteers to can help us with approving content on the ETC website. To maintain quality assurance, each change to the website requires the approval of 3 moderators, which can sometimes take several days to coordinate if they aren't online, and we want to reduce the time this takes in future so we need more mods. It's pretty easy work, mostly just spot checking new apps and other content submitted by other users via pull requests - if have a github account and would like to help out with that let us know on Discord.

## Questions

- Who is Cody Burns, what is his backstory, and how does he relate to Ethereum Classic?

### Community Fund

- Can you give our listeners a quick history of the multisig fund and what it's role is?
- What is the signature threahold for spending funds in the multisig?
- "I think the main concern is whether the contract still works. Take say 1 ETC out of the fund and then put it back in or something. We trust the 6 keyholders."
- Are you worried that any of the key holders might be inactive?
- Do you think there should be new/rotated keyholders?
- Should the multisig contract or procedure be changed in any way for technical or social reasons?
- Should the funds be left alone to gather more value before spending?
- What do _you_ think the funds should be used for?
- Thoughts on experimenting with a DAO structure for some of the funds, how might it be structured?
- What are your thoughts on the Protocol Layer Treasury debate and Withdrawal Announcement?

**Opportunity for audience to ask question RE: Community Funds**

### Top Picks

- Is ETC a sinking ship?
- What do you want to see happen next on ETC?
- Could you share your perspective on the stuff that happened with ETC Labs? Would any of those folks ever restart the Lab?
- Mystique Fork, doesn't it break Code is Law?
- What do you see as ETC's biggest technological weakness? How can that area be improved upon?
- Have you changed your mind about NFTs? What happens to NFTs in case of a chain split? What other use cases do you see for transfer of ownership and information?
- I am still waiting for my smart contract door opener for my Airbnb. The slock.it boys tried... Is this still something appropiate for chains like ETC? The properties the ETC chain guarentee are appropiate for what type of apps & industries in your opinion as a blockchain architect? In general, seems we are at a crossroad where the crypto industry creates the tools either for wikileak/freedom or for WEF/CCP/surveillance state.
- What has changed in 2021 regarding supply chains comparing with previous years. Are blockchains changing businesses for the better? Are old industries ready for adoption?

**If time, opportunity for audience to ask any questions**

In general, seems we are at a crossroad where the crypto industry creates the tools either for wikileak/freedom or for WEF/CCP/surveillance state.
- Digital retail companies are starting using blockchains for food traceability purposes. Will this trend continue for other products?
- The Hyperledger Foundation is providing supply chains and ways of sustainability in the real world domains. How much has the industry grown and how are private network evolving comparing to open-public networks?
- What has changed in 2021 regarding supply chains comparing with previous years. Are blockchains changing businesses for the better? Are old industries ready for adoption?
