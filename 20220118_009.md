## Questions

- Who is Cody Burns, what is his backstory, and how does he relate to Ethereum Classic?

### Community Fund

- Can you give our listeners a quick history of the multisig fund and what it's role is?
- What is the signature threahold for spending funds in the multisig?
- "I think the main concern is whether the contract still works. Take say 1 ETC out of the fund and then put it back in or something. We trust the 6 keyholders."
- Are you worried that any of the key holders might be inactive?
- Do you think there should be new/rotated keyholders?
- Should the multisig contract or procedure be changed in any way for technical or social reasons?
- Should the funds be left alone to gather more value before spending?
- What do *you* think the funds should be used for?
- Thoughts on experimenting with a DAO structure for some of the funds?
- What are your thoughts on the Protocol Layer Treasury debate and Withdrawal Announcement?

### Top Picks

- Is ETC a sinking ship?
- What do you want to see happen next on ETC?
- Could you share your perspective on the stuff that happened with ETC Labs? Would any of those folks ever restart the Lab?
- What do you see as ETC's biggest technological weakness? How can that area be improved upon? 
- Have you changed your mind about NFTs? What happens to NFTs in case of a chain split? What other use cases do you see for transfer of ownership and information? 
- I am still waiting for my smart contract door opener for my Airbnb. The slock.it boys tried... Is this still something appropiate for chains like ETC? The properties the ETC chain guarentee are appropiate for what type of apps & industries in your opinion as a blockchain architect? In general, seems we are at a crossroad where the crypto industry creates the tools either for wikileak/freedom or for WEF/CCP/surveillance state.
- What has changed in 2021 regarding supply chains comparing with previous years. Are blockchains changing businesses for the better? Are old industries ready for adoption?

### All General Questions

- Versioning 
- An ETC Constitution
- What do you want to see happen in 2022 on ETC?
- The SHA3 switch & Secret ASICs
- Could you share your perspective on the stuff that happened with ETC Labs? Would any of those folks ever restart the Lab?

- What's chipper robotics roadmap for etc
- Do you still have a small robot which is controlled by smart contract puttering around in your kitchen?
- What do you see as ETC's biggest technological weakness? How can that area be improved upon? 
- What, in your opinion, has the ETC community gotten right so far? And where has the community fallen short?
- I am still waiting for my smart contract door opener for my Airbnb. The slock.it boys tried... Is this still something appropiate for chains like ETC? The properties the ETC chain guarentee are appropiate for what type of apps & industries in your opinion as a blockchain architect? In general, seems we are at a crossroad where the crypto industry creates the tools either for wikileak/freedom or for WEF/CCP/surveillance state.
- Digital retail companies are starting using blockchains for food traceability purposes. Will this trend continue for other products?
- The Hyperledger Foundation is providing supply chains and ways of sustainability in the real world domains. How much has the industry grown and how are private network evolving comparing to open-public networks?
- What has changed in 2021 regarding supply chains comparing with previous years. Are blockchains changing businesses for the better? Are old industries ready for adoption?
- Can you explain how Hyperledger is used in supply chains for airplanes and military, because we know that the supplies that are being tracked are worth millions of dollars?
- Would you compare the blockchain adoption that is happening now with the internet adoption?
- How much efficiency can tokenization bring for supply chains?
- Would you agree that technology is now scalable and has achieved mainstream adoption in an accelerated manner? What examples from the industry do you like? 
- Have you changed your mind about NFTs? What happens to NFTs in case of a chain split? What other use cases do you see for transfer of ownership and information? 
- Can you explain verifiable credentials in smart contracts, maybe give us some examples from the industry?
- How far are we from automation blockchain with smart contracts for industrial robots?
- The Hyperledger Besu is a great client that can connect permission private networks with permissionless blockchains, which means that consumers can participate. Do you see ETC attracting business development from the private sector? 
- The negative interest rates are affecting fiat and also stable coins. Do you see a potential danger for the crypto environment, can innovation be stopped in this field?
- Will blockchain bring an extending role of the dollar on the internet. Can we a expect a Trans-Atlantic alignment and joined regulatory framework for stable coins in the near future, because it seems that innovation is stagnating in comparison to Est-en countries, like China?
- Do you see a rising demand for stable coins, could ETC be part in this ecosystem that is being build as a layer foundation for faster inter-operability between states?
- Are CBDC a necessity at this stage for crypto in general?
- To your knowledge, how is the military using smart contracts? Just curious.
