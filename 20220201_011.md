## Meeting Minutes

The weekly Ethereum Classic Community Call 011 was held on 2022.02.01 at 1500 UTC on Ethereum Classic Discord.

### Overview

The meeting could not be held as per original agenda plan due to certain reasons. So, the participant had to fall back on open discussion. The chair informed the participants that that Mr. Afri, once an Ethereum Classic hard fork coordinator, will be joining the next weekly call. Several Agenda Items such as SHA-3, ETC Meme Machine, Gitcoin account, transition plan , up-gradation of the system to thwart any potential nefarious activities, rebranding of Ethereum Classic in future etc. were discussed at length. The participants shared their ideas and views, the gist of which is as under;

### Points

1. **Collecting Questions for Mr. Afri:** Mr. Afri, once an Ehereum Classic hardball coordinator, will be joining the next weekly call. We need to collect questions for him for benefitting from his experience and knowledge.
1. **SHA-3:** Transition to SHA-3 is an ongoing debate, and to prevent system failure, a deep analysis of the transition is needed. For this purpose, complete homework is to be made, things are to be quantified and a comprehensive case is to be prepared. Henry added that he will come up with a comprehensive transition proposal that will incorporate both GPUs and SHA-3. He further apprised that he would propose to split the Proof of Work algorithms into a transition, which will make the network resilient from any potential nefarious activities, because we would be having the ability of SHA-3 side to fall back on GPUs and FPGAs.
1. **ETC Meme Machine:** The chair floated the proposal of having a Twitter account that simply reposts the images that have been previously posted in the Memes Channel on Discord, systematically calculating the number of shares and exposure each image gets. We may have a different theme for each week, and at the end of week, a small prize be awarded in ETC to encourage propaganda engine to churn out some memes.
1. **ETC DAO Discussion and Direction, Gitcoin:** While updating the participants on creation of a Gitcoin account and further linking it to ETC DAO, Ronin stated that he had seen an account already set up with the name of Ethereum Classic but its ownership in Gitcoin is still unknown. We will have to figure it out and see if they are willing to give that name over for ETC, and in case of refusal, we will create a new name. Besides, we should maintain a list of small projects and bounties, out of which we will select some for putting them on Gitcoin. Apart from that, a proposal for Gitcoin, incorporating budgetary matters and pricing needs to be submitted.
1. **Roadmap 2022: Layer 2, Chainlink Integration, Bridges, Onramps, Tuning Gas, Rebranding, Versioning, Etc**
   A lot of people think that Ethereum Classic is just a rip-off of Ethereum or a fork of Ethereum , and is trying to cash in on Ethereum&#39;s success. They also think that Ethereum Classic came after Ethereum. This misunderstanding needs to be cleared. Consensus about rebranding the name seems to be tough in the current circumstances. However, move to SHA-3 can provide us with the justification for rebranding in future. Besides rebranding, the views on layer 2 solutions and bridging chains were shared. It was discussed that while thinking of Bridge, two questions strike the mind. The first one is whether there is already a standard framework that can easily be deployed on ETC, and the second one is as what is required in terms of centralization, in terms of operating the bridge and acting as a custodian. If we go to Binance, we will find a page and that is a bridge. We can prop something like that very easily and set up contracts accordingly. It is a decentralized approach as well, because they run on DPOs on Binance Smart Chain.
1. **Educational Campaigns:** It was also discussed during the meeting that people may be incentivized and motivated to know about Ethereum Classic. $3 be paid as reward upon completion of an educational activity designed to create awareness about ETC.

### Action Points

1. Mr. Afriwill be joining the next weekly call on Ethereum Discord. All will come up with relevant questions/queries for Mr. Afri.
2. Henry will submit a comprehensive transition plan within next few days.
3. A new dedicated call will be arranged for discussing the SHA3 transition plan.
4. Creation of a Twitter for reposting images that have been previously posted in the Memes Channel on Discord.
5. Creation of a Gitcoin account and linking it to ETC DAO.
6. Submission of a proposal for Gitcoin, incorporating budgetary matters and pricing.
7. The great ideas generated on this forum be recorded and documented in the form of minutes of meeting.
8. Proposals regarding awareness campaigns about Ethereum Classic by incentivising the people be prepared.

### DAO Action Points from Ronin

- ETCDAO (on-chain DAO - no jurisdiction) & Ethereum Classic DAO LLC (legal entity) are being setup.
- Contacted legal to setup the formal Ethereum Classic DAO LLC (legal entity) - This will be a good vehicle to replace ETC Coop for Corporate sponsorships and tax write-off donations. I still need to talk with legal on how to properly register and draft up the operating agreement for this entitiy. Think Ethereum Foundation but with a goal of decentralizing. This is being formed for any stuff that "needs a legal entity" behind it. Let's not mention this one until the legal paperwork is done. EthereumClassicDAO.org/.net/.com
- ETC DAO - The rough, wild-west DAO that isn't bound to any jurisdiction. An approach that may be beneficial- no legal entity. So perfect for launching these "Positive feedback funding loop" protocols: AMM, bridges, Liquidity protocols... This is the one we have been talking about publicly. ETCDAO.org./.net (.com was taken)

The meeting ended with the vote of thanks to and from the Chair.
