## Notes

> I had seen a couple of questions here about Grayscale and funding.
>
> I can confirm that Grayscale funding of the ETC Cooperative came to a close at the end of March, as expected, and as I signalled was likely many times over the past few months. So as of April, we are do not have any ongoing funding, but are sitting on $5M+ USD and several hundred thousand dollars worth of ETC.
>
> As an aside for any ETCG holders (and as noted by somebody earlier) the fees for that fund have now dropped from 3% to 2.5%, which brings them in line with most of the other Grayscale funds. And ETCG, like the other funds, it remains on track for eventual conversion to an ETF.
>
> ... Total spend for ETC Cooperative in 2021 was just under $500K.
>
> Budgeted spend for ETC Cooperative in 2022 is $1.6M (we have added the Core-Geth developers since 2021 and have budget for a further three hires during the year, plus a grants program).
>
> We are sitting on over $5M USD and several hundred K worth of ETC.
>
> So the burn rate likely sees us with around 4 years of runway.
