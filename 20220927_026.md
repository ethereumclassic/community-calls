- (ronin) Network tools Idea
  - topic: future public goods, permalinks. Available TLD Domains for these network necessities as we grow into the future. Can we IPFS some of these too? Definitely possible is static pages. cc: @Istora 
  - ethereumclassic.net network tools coming from this TLD makes sense to me. I'd be happy to dedicate this entire TLD to these type of public good assets for ETC.
  - public RPC endpoint
  - hashrate monitor
  - mempool tracker - similar to https://mempool.space/
  - ETC gas estimator 
  - fork or reorg monitor
  - active node monitor
  - network analytics - a public subgraph?
  - other helpful grafana dashboards?
