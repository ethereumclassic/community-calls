A casual voice chat to discuss ideas for ETC. All are welcome.

**This week we are testing out Twitter Spaces!**

For those of us joining us on Twitter for the first time: this call has been held weekly on Tuesdays at 1500 UTC in the ETC community Discord server at ethereumclassic.org/discord. We're experimenting with Twitter Spaces.

**Join the Green Room 1 hour before we go live to chat offline**

This voice chat is an open discussion so please feel free to jump in any time. Please use the raise hand emoji if you want to speak and we will grant you access, twitter spaces limits this to 10. Please be reminded this is live streaming on YouTube, so if you are on the mic please follow Twitter's rules. As this is our first time on Twitter, please let's try to keep things respectful.

You can also post questions and comments on Discord in #community-call-notes, on Twitter, or on YouTube we'll try respond to your messages.

You can find the agenda in a reply to this space, which contains links to everything we talk about.
