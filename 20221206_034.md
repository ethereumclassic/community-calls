### Coinbase Wallet Delisting

https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1597695219352621057

- BCH, ETC, XLM & XRP
- Custodial Wallet only, still on coinbase (for now)
- They claim low volume
- If you have ETC in coinbase wallet, do not worry, your seed phrase can get your etc in another wallet

- Why did they do it? Let's discuss!
- Volume seems like a made up excude
- Warning sign for the future?

### Danoz

- ETC is "ultra compatible" (Genesis block)
- ETC has no public audit node, that will change!
- Erigon will help

> You’re welcome to read the following article, but it focuses on OpenEthereum which has reached its “end of life” and will be discontinued. Not to mention the fact that Erigon lessens the requirement of running an archive node from six (6) months of syncing and 12 TB of hard drive space to three (3) weeks of syncing and 2.5 TB of hard drive space. You read that right. Check it out.

> Update Jan 20, 2021: Since writing this article, we’ve come upon a project called TurboGeth (now called Erigon). It reduces the size of the hard drive needed for an archive node from 6TB to around 1.5TB. Significant difference. That’s the same amount of data and much lower cost.
