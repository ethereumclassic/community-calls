### Merit Badge

**Ronin**

"Merit Badge" system to encourage participation or reward it. A good use of the NFT communities development in 2022 to a public good project that encourages engagements and allows people to build a collection of collectables to show they're helping with ETC.

- Airdrop Contribution ERC-20 tokens to specific contributors
- Tokens can be redeemed for Merit Badge style NFTs

inspiration: Chia Network's 2021 "CH21" Token Airdrop for first year miners. 2022 Chia NFT Redemption.

2021 CAT Token Airdrop: https://www.chia.net/2021/12/21/happy-holidays-from-chia/

2022 NFT Claim using the 2021 CH21 Token: https://www.chia.net/2022/12/08/the-holiday-nfts-are-here/

- Goal, increases on-chain transactions and usage.
- provides fun assets that show people are volunteering and when (some OG credit)
- gets users familar with tinckering and managing ERC-20's/NFTs on ETC
- teaches users how to manage their assets in an ETC address. Self-custody.

Would be fun to do these around:

- Mainnet Launch Anniversaries
- Hardfork DAO anniversaries
- Post-Merge Anniversaries
- Holidays

Could retro airdrop people(on-chain addresses) that were active in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. With Year based merits

Could add a historical element to this and have collections that honor the deep thinkers that brought us specific tech that ETC uses. Example is "Nick Szabo" and his Smart Contract article. So these airdropped tokens could be redeemed for something like that.

Airdrop/Redeemable to anyone that mined a block in previous years. "Security" badge or something. There are a lot of ways do to this and themes, but maybe start with a simple proof-of-concept. Make it a simple open-source site hosted in a community organized repo.

**TheCrowbill**

Excellent idea! I have been studying and updating the POAP contracts (https://github.com/TheCrowbill-testorg/poap-contracts) for deployment on ETC. This looks like a use case that would be ideal to build around. Thank you, @ronin.

I had planned to deploy updated contracts on Mordor last week, but some dependency issues cropped up which has delayed things. Anyone wanting to help out with this project is welcome. Any help at all would be much appreciated. In addition to requiring some new coding for the contracts, there will be need for graphics, style and design elements, project coordinators and maintainers, and probably much more.

If the updated contracts work and are something the community can use and wants, I will happily transfer ownership of the repo to the ETC community.
