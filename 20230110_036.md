We are back, EEE TEE CEE IN TWENTEE THREE!

A casual voice chat to discuss ideas for ETC. All are welcome.

**Join the Green Room 30 mins before we go live to chat offline, from now on in the ethereumclassic.org/discord #community-calls channel**

This voice chat is an open discussion and anyone is free to join and chat. Please request access to speak in app, and make sure you're using a mobile version of the Twitter app as it doesn't allow speakers on the web version.

We are also live streamining the Space to YouTube, so if you are on the mic please follow Twitter and YouTube's rules.

You can also post questions and comments on Discord in #community-call-notes, on Twitter, or on YouTube we'll try respond to your messages.

You can find the agenda in a reply to this space, which contains links to everything we talk about.

## Topics

### 2022 Review: Dead Chain Happenings

#### Mystique Hard Fork Successful

In Feb 2022, the Mystique hard fork was implemented

#### SHA3 Debate and Defeat

After many months of debate, including on these calls, the SHA3 proposal was posponed until after the merge, at which point it became apparent there was no immediate need for it.

The engasged ETC community avoided implementing this which was a win.

#### Funding

- Community fund confirmed available by cody, etc.
- DCG Stops Funding ETC Coop
- Bitmain / Antpool Grants Confirmed on Chain

Now, Ethereum Classic is fueled up with many millions of capital to be invested in projects.

#### ETC Ecosystem

Speaking of projects, even without funding, 2022 saw the emergence of many new deployments.

- ETC Defi Emerges
- Launch of ETCSwap and HebeSwap
- First Bridges
- First Stablecoins
- NFT Boom
- New Channels and Discussions

#### DAO Hacker Unmasked

Interestingly the identity of the The DAO Hacker was discovered and published via Laura Shin.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/

The actions of this blackhat hacker started a series of events that led to the declaration of ETC.

#### Twitter Hijack

Speaking of ethically questionable behaviour,

In October 2022, the Ethereum Classic Twitter account of 650k followers was hijacked by Dr. Charles Hoskinson, and rebradned to IOHK's pet project Ergo.

In response, this actually helped the project in the long run by sparking the creation of the twitter-together repos, which provides transparency and openness.

#### Big Update from ETC Coop with new Team

Near the end of 2022, ETC Coop announces it's expanded operations with additioanl team members, and notably friend of the call Donald.

#### Saving the best till last: ETC becomes the permier secure smart contract platform

- ETH's transition to PoS was initiated (still in progress), so no longer required miners
- Much of the hashrate migrated to ETC, which saw a massive increase in hashrate
- ETC is now a top 5 PoW chain, and the only uncensorable smart contract platform
- Vitalik Endorses ETC as "Perfectly good blockchain"

### 2023 Looking Forward

#### Erigon

Preview ETC Erigon client is available for testing

#### Grants Program

The Antpool / Bitmain grants program is active.

We are hoping for updates on the grants process very soon.

In any case, this will create a continuous stream of good news for ETC and real world utility for the chain.

### 2023 New Years Resolutions

#### Guests

Let's try to get more guests on the call.

#### Discord

Let's build the discord community and improve the discord server with bots and functionality that makes it a hub of activity

#### Education

Let's spread the word of ETC and make it easier for new entrants to understand why it's an important project. Lets devise ways to incentivise, perhaps POAPs and lotteries, to encourage people to learn about ETC and spread the word.

#### Automation and Integrations

- Summarize the calls via ai to create an easy to read summary
- Make it so PRs are automatically created to the Twitter repos to make things easier
- UI to update the website more easily
- Hub for events and activities in ETC to bridge communities
- Schedule Tweets
