It’s been a while—let’s catch up.

Join us on Friday, April 25th at 1500 UTC in the ETC Discord for a casual voice chat. Whether you’ve been around or just checking in, this is an open space to reconnect, hear what folks are working on, and share what’s on your mind.

No formal agenda, just a chance to get a read on the community and talk about where ETC is headed. We’ll keep it light, respectful, and productive.

The call will be recorded and uploaded for anyone who can’t make it live.

Meet us in the ETC Discord’s #community-calls channel.
