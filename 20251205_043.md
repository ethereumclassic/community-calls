Join us for the next **Ethereum Classic development working session**, focused on **ECIP-1113: The Olympia DAO Governance Framework** — the next stage following the **BASEFEE redirect (ECIP-1111)** and **Treasury Contract (ECIP-1112)**.  

This session continues the formal **ECIP-1000** process and explores implementation details for the **Olympia DAO governance model** and its activation pathway. We’ll review the audited, modular **OpenZeppelin Governor** contract suite widely used across the EVM ecosystem, compare voting-system options, outline technical and proposal mechanics, and draft the initial plan for the upcoming **Mordor testnet deployment** of the Treasury + DAO pair.
