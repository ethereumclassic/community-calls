Topics covered:
  possible EIP 1559 miner event to observe on april 1st (on eth chain & unrelated to etc)
  [ETC chain is being used for covid 19 verification](https://ubirch.de/en/v)
  ETC is less profitable to mine than other coins despite having similar transaction throughput
      - possible cause was 51% attacks making exchange times long so etc did not rise in price with market
      - why are exchange times still long if mess is in place?
      - network appears generally healthy even with lower hash rate
  
  
  Next meeting to be held in ~2 weeks in similar format
