Notes 

```
In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees:[1][2][3]

Consistency
    Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Availability
    Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
Partition tolerance
    The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
```
