https://github.com/ethereumclassic/community-calls/issues/21

What we observe in Community Calls is that there's not really an incentive to participate.
People join the Calls but there's no retention.

Why could this be?

Recordings: People will listen to the recording afterwards. This is good to inform but harms engagement.
Program: There's too little room for speech, moderators talk too much. It lacks interactivity.
Privacy: The calls aren't encrypted and people dox themselves when they use their voice.
Language: This goes along with the recording of the event but I believe many aren't comfortable to speak in public, often in a foreign language.
For these points the evolution of the [Green Room] is a great initiative, let's improve on that with this thread.

What are your obstacles to participate and how do you see the solution or do you have a solution to someone else's obstacle?
