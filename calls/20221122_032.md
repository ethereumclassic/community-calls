A casual voice chat to discuss ideas for ETC. All are welcome.

**This week we are testing out Twitter Spaces!**

For those of us joining us on Twitter for the first time: this call has been held weekly on Tuesdays at 1500 UTC in the ETC community Discord server at ethereumclassic.org/discord. We're experimenting with Twitter Spaces.

**Join the Green Room 1 hour before we go live to chat offline**

This voice chat is an open discussion so please feel free to jump in any time. Please use the raise hand emoji if you want to speak and we will grant you access, twitter spaces limits this to 10. Please be reminded this is live streaming on YouTube, so if you are on the mic please follow Twitter's rules. As this is our first time on Twitter, please let's try to keep things respectful.

You can also post questions and comments on Discord in #community-call-notes, on Twitter, or on YouTube we'll try respond to your messages.

You can find the agenda in a reply to this space, which contains links to everything we talk about.
 
## Agenda

## Last Week in ETC

Overall, unsurprisingly bearish week due to wider ecosystem trends. Whole crypto market is down due to FTX scandal, which we will get into and how it relates to ETC later.

### Vitals

**Not financial Advice!**

### Ecosystem

- ethereumclassic.org now in Chinese https://ethereumclassic.org/zh/
  - https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/issues/992 Below is the proposed schedule for launching new locales, one each week.
- ETC Cooperative 2022 Q3 Report https://etccooperative.org/posts/2022-11-17-q3-report-en 
  - Initiated Erigon development work, a Go-Ethereum fork that reduces bloat: Full synchronization on ETC took a few days, and used about 160 GB.
  - Gnosis Safe to ETC mainnet and Mordor testnet: Ethereum Classic Safe
  - Documentation: A website for “Risk Evaluation of 51-Percent Attacks on Ethereum Classic” has been created so the community can further trust the ETC blockchain. https://meowsbits.github.io/51-percent-docs/, showing ETC has 6x the more then the next ETHASH Mining
  - Ended September of 2022 with liquid assets, including cash plus $ETC, of over $5.5M USD.
  - Budgeted spending was $414K USD to the end of Q3 but actual spending was only $239K USD.
- Who is Bob Summerwill? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbZ6mZKduD4

### Show and Tell

- Anything missed above, new apps, nfts, projects, comments from participants?

## Topics

### Twitter Spaces

- Twitter Spaces
  - Anyone want to say hello?
  - Anyone familiar with Twitter Spaces? Can you help in some way?
  - Just testing
  - Bare with us
  - No Video 
  - Moderation

### FTX Fallout Continues: Impact of DCG, Grayscale, ETCG. Metrics/Vitals?

- DCG exposure to Gemini
- May effect ETC price if DCG is forced to sell ETC
- FTX fiasco is still not over, and regulators are using this to punish crypto
- Reality is that they could have been leveraging pokemon cards, not really to do with crypto

### Ronin's question about infrastructure grants

What's going on with ETC Coop infrastructure $250k grants? It's been about a year without material progress on donated funds from Grayscale. Solution GitCoin and have the grants up within a week.

### Mastodon

- https://ethereumclassic.network domain as a Mastodon server. Names to be issued to contributors. Allows ETC community to link their twitter handles to a vanity masodon name. @username@ethereumclassic.network

> thinking about incentives for participation and the POAP stuff. We are thinking about NFTs, but what about a real life account that will populate all over mastodon.  
> 
> Potential reward for contributors: @username@ethereumclassic.network mastodon username accounts that you can bridge to any of your twitter accounts via:
> https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/
> 
> My understanding is setting up the server would be about $6/mo on costs for the service. Could be a good use for this domain if it incentivizes contributions. Chat about it, let me know if there is an appetite for it.
> 
> and the proof of contributions would be a way to earn these names. opposed to something like an ENS where you pay for the name.
> This would also allows us to have a historical record of accounts via the twitter linking, so if the users account is banned on twitter, they can relink their new twitter account to their vanity ethereum classic mastodon and keep posting (thinking of Donald here with his frequent twitter names). So @DonaldMcIntyre@ethereumclassic.network would maintain a feed of all his posts despite changing twitter names due to their ToS or whater, as an example. 
> Also perhaps we could brand/theme up the mastodon instance and give it an ETC feel for users.

### MegaBrdige Idea

- Building on the firehose idea mentioned previously
- One channel to rule them all
- Discord, Telegram, Matrix, Twitter, Mastodon, Github, etc.
- Moderation

## "LAN Party" Idea

- Pump nights

## Etcetera

- Web Updates, Automations, Auto-adding content, https://nvu.io/en/bots/discord-translator, Auto add Youtube, weekly top tweets
- Nomenclature: Profitability, Profits, Block Rewards, etc.
- Tweet Bank
- Rico
