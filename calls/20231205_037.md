the community talk about the spiral upgrade that that is coming very soon it's already been implemented on the mort test net uh and um Etc core developers uh need to talk about it po a block number for the upgrade but let's wait two or three more minutes to see if more people join this call if you guys want to TW this alert people that the call is started would help people to come here let's wait until till now it's whatever your time is 01 let's wait until 05 have you started the recording

00:00:59
already bro bro is in charge of that bro is everything going okay yeah I already already start the streaming and recording good I'm getting a bit of echo on Bob's audio those who are coming in now we are going to wait until it's uh whatever your time is 03 until 05 let other people join this call start to call about the spiral hard Fork okay I am the Donald McIntyre again senior editor at the ETC Cooperative this is the here classic Community call the developer call to talk about the

00:04:13
coming spiral heart Fork on Etc um first we're we're gonna I'm going to give um give it to Diego Lopez Leon EC core developer to talk about ecip 11 own nine that explains hard fork and the and the goals um then the core developers are going to propose um clock number timing Etc and then everybody can will be able to ask questions and we can also talk after this after talking about spiral we can talk about the ethereum classic Noe count for example um the ETC cooperatives um three report and other issues that you

00:05:03
may have but first we're going to talk about the bcip 1109 for the spiral hard fork and Diego could you could you uh Diego could you talk to us about about um ecip 1109 and and the spir hard Fork what is it about also about the the block number yes I'm sorry I was uh into the wrong panel probably um yeah I was there with with Andrew so yeah uh to to make it quick uh this proposal was to activate um spiral on block uh nine uh 19 mil 250,000 uh which is um uh Target to uh the end of January uh January 20 uh 31st

00:06:00
so basically the idea will be the enable the the same eips that we enable on Mordor uh during the the last week of August so to to go through the the the new changes for that uh you can open well I will share I don't know if you all have the the link for the for the ecip I don't know where I can share it but yeah you can fed in ecips eum classy.org ecips e-109 so uh the first one we want to include um all of this have been already tested on M and activated successfully after some glitches but otherwise

00:06:50
everything is working fine there uh at the moment so uh the first EIP will be the the warm coin coinbase which is something that um will make um transactions cheaper once you get when once you use the the coinbase address whenever you have to interact interact with this uh that address will be considered in a warm state which is uh basically a an an yeah I then it's consider that it it's going to be an address that you are going to use probably so any interaction with it will be cheaper uh also um another nice adding

00:07:38
for for this upgrade is the push zero instruction which uh will make the the bite code of the compiled um solidity smart contract or well any other language that will compile to B code uh will be smaller and also The Well of of course the execution will be cheaper because it's a single instruction instead of of three as it was before um also that is uh that's for 3855 uh another one is uh 3860 which is limit and meter init code which is basically a limit in the size of the of the code that it's been used for

00:08:25
deploying uh smart contracts so it's making it uh with a with a limit that before we we didn't have one uh so that's something interesting and also uh this is just a note that this this is not something out of the consensus but it's important to mention it is the deprecation of the self-destruct the the the self-destruct instruction this is something that we missed in the past from the Paris upgrate from ethereum so if you check the shanhai notes the for the execution client you will not find

00:08:59
this but but please go to to the Paris one and you will see this one uh this note uh no sorry this sorry I missed this uh the deprecation of sruct is in Shanghai the one that we missed before is the is the other one that it says uh supplant difficulty of code with prefer andal that was something that was present in Paris uh we didn't had any any mention of it before and here in in this ecip we are stating that we are not including that um replacement so everything will be the same for us and

00:09:36
also we are not including uh withdrawals from the Von chain because we don't have a Von chain so that's yeah we're are not we're not including it so that's that's the list of of all the the eips that we're including in into this upcoming harport very good thank you Diego so just to confirm again Diego the the block number is $1,250,000 yes and when do you estimate that that is going to happen uh on January 31st 3 see yeah 31st January 31st or the last week of January first week of Feb very

00:10:25
good okay now now um I don't know if Chris or Isaac would like to add comments about the the hard Fork before I open it to questions ISAC would you like to comment something uh only to com can't hear you Chris you have comments I couldn't hear Isaac as well uh no I think uh everything has been noted uh tomorrow we'll also provide tomorrow or the next day most probably tomorrow we will provide uh a new page with information uh with the upcoming uh Fork to the community probably we will

00:11:26
share The Links at General and Twitter Etc going to be additional information about the fork yes uh on how many node operators have upgraded when it comes the status of oh yeah that page yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a page of the list of all the contact that we need to contact the community has to contact to operators exchanges miners mining pools Etc that are going to start we're going to start tracking who migrated to spiral very good so now it's open to the Community anybody who who wishes to ask questions

00:12:02
to Diego Lopez Leon about um spiral heart Fork ecip 1109 or Isaac Aris or Chris zogas um please ask the questions now guys thanks for relaying the information of the Block announcement to the community I had a question question from weer Garten in the general Channel that I just wanted to relay which is Will spiral bring compatibility for the recent solidity versions yes yes the answer it's it's yes basically the the the most important chance is this addition of push zero so yes excellent and just to clarify for some

00:12:58
uh for for the I guess non-developer side is the the word deprecation of self-destruct it's not going to affect the uh ability for existing contracts to use this op code it's merely a uh a recommendation for developers to to not implement this op code is that correct yes for the moment that's that's a recommendation uh it's possible I mean that in the future this will change but it's up to this discussion probably yeah on on on different forums but for the moment yes we are not changing any any

00:13:42
Behavior here I'm not sure if uh developers already tested uh this hard for on M uh M has already H made the upgrade to this hardw workk and it will be great if developers want to run their contracts to deploy their contracts on moror so as we are sure before the hard work that everything was works great we have done our testing so far and everything is good but the more is better yeah I completely second back please test on more door that is important that the there's that was a big change the strategy of

00:14:37
upgrades um for developers decided to separate the upgrade in the test Nets and the and the the main net so now uh developers can can spiral and all all the changes in the test net um before or uh everything used to be done at the same time uh and and could um create uh problems but but now it's they they separated upgrades vther Garten I don't know if you you had a question before I saw on the general Channel about smart contracts about smart contract ability yeah I don't think Warden is

00:15:27
joining on The Voice call uh just observing but that was the question that I posed uh before very good anybody else has other questions about the um dock number hard Fork spiral the the op codes Etc yeah when uh when should we expect uh the cor gath client to be released uh so we can be begin uh the process of telling people to upgrade uh this week will be for sure we we already have all the pool request uh there and and waiting for for this call to happen so yeah that that will happen this week for

00:16:18
sure great and then uh is bezu were will there be a release for that client or is that client being deprecated uh yes there will be also a release for B might not be this week yes yeah it will depend on the on the release process of the B Team until the second part of that question is basically being depreciated at some point uh yeah well for for the moment the the the client that we are supporting from the ITC Cooperative is a coret uh we are still using Vu mostly for testing and for compatibility but is

00:17:07
not our main target anymore so hey Bob here um so yeah we're not recommending bzu use for end users um so that's sort of the status so we're maintaining those code paths primarily for for testing purposes but not recommending that anyone uses bezo anymore in terms of the Mordor test net what is the status of that are there many nodes operating on it and uh has it been stable so far well as as of how many uh not we have there uh it's it's hard to say we I think we don't have the the same tooling

00:18:05
that we have for for mayet for monitoring um the the network of Mortor I mean in the the diversity of of clients and and their the upgrade they running on but uh so far we didn't have any any report of anything broken there our own noes are still running fine our testing was successful so everything looks was looking fine there yeah can you hear me we can't hear you first first yeah heard there yeah another second yeah um I just just just wanted to add just to Ballpark the estimate for the

00:19:04
node obviously they're not numbers that you can rely oniss is going to possible but uh [Music] in like there's a problem with the connection okay well I'll leave it and I'll put it in it comes and goes well maybe if you want to say what you wanted to say maybe we catch the idea anyway all right are there any questions questions or comments about the spiral hard Fork pcip 1109 uh I have one uh what do you guys need uh out of the community um we'll probably just off the top of my head uh

00:20:16
need some blog posts out for information is ETC Co-op taking care of that um artwork um any sort of marketing cop copy to bring awareness to this I think the timing's great uh people will be back and paying attention from the holidays uh but you know the general awareness of what's going on and maybe generate a little excitement um on achieving protocol parody again uh we don't get these extremely frequent so it's uh I think it's a great event for for us to kind of rally around and kind of Make some noise

00:20:58
and let people know that um ethereum classic is a state-ofthe-art evm so just let us know what you guys need yes the there's going to be a page this Fork specifically with all contacts that we have gathered that we need to reach that has to be a community effort no like like every hard for everybody in the community through all social channels through Twitter and uh Facebook on on telegram Discord uh sending emails Etc whoever can contact all mining pools wallet operators um infrastructure providers

00:21:47
like like rivet rivet or the other node uh RPC and node providers uh any other kind of uh economic node or or people Etc MC well they they have the majority of the notes are from so they have to do the upgrade all those users have to press the button up and upgrade to spiral um yeah uh blog post any effort that everybody in the community can do would help the whole ecosystem to migrate are there any braking changes expected if someone doesn't migrate yes it's uh basically it's really important that you upgrade

00:22:43
because this is a a network operator hardwork so at the point the that block is Rich if you are using an an old client without the the activation block your basically your not will will stop sinking with the with the rest of the network as soon as I mean we can say as soon as there uh comes a transaction that will break the previous consensus so that that it is expected to happen pretty soon after the activation so yeah it's it's really really important and we assume that if PE if the community if the the ecosystem shall

00:23:28
we say the miners and the uh the exchanges do not upgrade in time there's opportunity to delay the hard fork or is there is there a plan B if that doesn't happen not saying that it's likely but if if for some reason it does there's no plan B we die yeah we have to evaluate when it happens for the reasons that it happened that quickly other than that all right so let's get uh let's get the word out this is why we test this on Mordor and yeah and we are also having giv almost

00:24:15
two months up front for for all of us prepared to it there's already some community resources being created now that we announce the block number see here uh on on the general Channel Bob uh posted the link to the viral Fork list of all the people we need to contact I am update that updating that list is 119 uh contacts uh I need to clean the last 19 and I'm going to add some more some more exchanges and I already added all the new mining pools last work I'm going to add new exchanges because some

00:25:03
some exchanges close some some of these entities close and then new ones appear so I'm I'm I'm updating that part as well uh and then uh Dr ignas SPS um also known as Mario he uh just posted a link to a dashboard to his dashboard that has a a monitor that that um counts how many days how much time how many blocks are there till the to the hard Fork the community effort has already started stora um I think we can put a banner probably on the.org website and then maybe we could use one of the

00:25:51
development pages to post some of these resources for spiral uh monitoring yeah definitely that's a great idea can get that up tomorrow I think very good so as a summary the spir heart Fork is ecip 1109 the block number does anybody object or or would like to suggest the different timing or something if not we we can we can declare that we have consensus on the block number does anybody have an opinion or would like to object to the block number and the timing for January 31st for this hard

00:26:37
work please stop now if there's no objection then we can we can agree I think we can agree that there's rough consensus on this block number and it's going to be the the the block number that we're going to communicate the community is going to communicate to the rest of the ecosystem it is 19,250 th000 and the estimated date is January 31st um so now that we have spoken about those things does anybody want to talk about other issues for example I think one one important thing that has

00:27:15
happened in the last two or three weeks is that uh we have been uh counting always 400600 Etc nodes but now that ECMC had more or less 90% of of all the noes in the network which is basically core get notes but um that they're running on the ETC MC platform um we the core developers um yeah must run a few uh processes to to to count again and they added more notes ET IT that maybe they can explain and now it it happens to be uh that there's more than 4,400 notes so we had been under counting

00:28:06
apparently notes historically now there's more if you go to the ETC note Explorer um there's more than 4,400 noes of which 90% are ET noes so if anybody wants to talk about that we can talk about that talk about the ETC coopertive 43 report that was recently um published and any other issue so please ask your questions or if you want to do any comments please um please do it yeah so with all this new notes coming in to the network so related to SP will they be uh ready to to upgrade all the not or

00:28:58
how is that undergoing is that is there a repository where those nodes can connect for upgrades or are there um I don't know other channels which can they which they use to to pull the get client in I don't have a note I I don't know I don't know many things about so do you mean for the ETMC boxes or in general uh the boxes right in general I don't know no yeah I I don't know how how those uh that project works I I assume they take it from the official release page but uh one three I'm I'm not

00:29:56
sure B would you like to address the the issue of atmc and the and their upgrade think you have you have spoken to M corac recently I know you have in news from there this is in terms of uh in terms of Etc Mt updates for the for the forum for spiral yes yes yeah so um you know as as per Seth all of those um all of those nodes are running um a vanilla cor gu client um but just with the identification string specifically overridden um so what should be needed for spiral is just when when there's a COR gu uh

00:30:54
version which is new enough um but that to be made available through that I believe there's an auto update mechanism or at least a um you know a flag would say hey there is a new version ready um so yeah when when we have a COR node uh ready um we can just coordinate that with uh with with their team so it should be kind of should be kind of easier with those is actually right because it's because it's a managed experience same sort of thing with d node um you know that you have a you have a UI for for managing

00:31:40
that okay great thanks I have an Etc MC node that now I turned off um because since since they a so large and they have a dominating count at least share of the ETC nodes and because they pay a token to to run the node and that node was going up in price so I decided to get out of that um because I think it's a conflict of interest for me to working at the ETC cooperative and run this node and to receive tokens so I liquidated the tokens I'm not running the node anymore so I just wanted to clarify that

00:32:22
I don't have anything to do with ETMC um ecosystem but I know how it works and yes it has a button when when each time you go to the UI the user interface there's a big button there that says upgrade that that um is off um but whenever uh there's an upgrade it's it's on and like an alert and you click it and it upgrades your your node or the core gu that it's inside the the machine the little box so this is good like Bob said because it's a managed experience once um or is

00:33:07
upgrade the the release the version with a release with spiral is out uh supposedly there the the company is going to alert all the 4,000 ECMC um me that they that they can upgrade to to the new core Gua core gu that is going to spiral and everybody is going to do it supposedly we have to see what happens if if if we see that it it's partial or some of them are not doing it we can just uh continue alerting them and and see how to they have a telegram channel it's a very active community so

00:33:48
we we should treat them like any other ecosystem member but I alerted about this being also a risk know what happens if they if they decide to attack EC actually uh create a different hard Fork then they would split so so this thing of having the button the automatic way or or or the upgrade alert for every because everybody's going to just blindly upgrade they don't even know what what the hard Fork is that they're just there to harvest the the token so that's a risk so so it's it's an

00:34:26
opportunity and also is we have to be aware of that I wanted to mention a couple things on this one is that I would assume that there has not been a major breaking release of gu which has been used in ECMC since the launch of ECMC so it will be a bit of a uh a first experience for that ecosystem so hopefully that goes smoothly and then second of all with regards to uh uh the risk of a network splitting I would imagine that it's not so important that the non- mining nodes are not upgrading because they'll simply be

00:35:10
using a version of a chain that's not getting mined properly so really the important things to Target in terms of ecosystem are exchanges and miners is this correct yes it is exactly like that agree I agree in my opinion that is that is correct but the thing is that when you have 90% of the nodes of a blockchain uh you can say I am the captain now and you can tell the mining pools and the miners don't follow the core deaths anymore now follow me I am the core def of ethereum classic and

00:35:48
we're not going to do spiral we're going to do this other upgrade and you have to follow my rules because I dominate that is the attack Factor why because they have a button that's all the 4,000 notes that these people are running um they just press it because they don't care about Etc they're just like miners that they're just earning the ETC P token um and they're selling it at $2 or something is going up in price it's a it's a fever granted this is this is probably

00:36:21
um ephemeral I don't think that I think it's just um like a bubble in that token and at some point they're going to realize the real volume is going to crash or something and threat going to be reduced significantly but when you have 90% of the nodes you could say I am the captain the captain now going to do I disagree a different hard work I could I could spin up a single person could spin up like 100,000 nodes if they wanted to it doesn't give them any power over the network unless

00:36:59
they're actually mining yes that's that's true yeah what I'm saying is that they could convince the miners that we have 4,000 noes uh don't follow what the core deps are saying follow us create a new version of eum plastic so right but right I think their their Fork if if they did that their Fork would have no hash rate and so I think that that's the that's the big difference these are validating notes not money notes so much different risk it would be completely a huge risk if this was 4,000 mining nodes

00:37:40
with a ton of hash power but they have no hash power right and there's no incentive for them to try to force or get miners to coordinate to mine an old version of the chain there's there's I I don't see any way they would coordinate to do that right their their token transactions wouldn't wouldn't be transferred on the main net so they would immediately lose their uh incentive to run those notes so I think I think uh I think we're going to be all right on that um it would I think it'd

00:38:21
be a completely different story um if it was mining I do see your risk though of that they just have an upgrade node and it's I I I believe that they're running their own release of corth so that could happen uh but I think it's isolated to a risk inside their project opposed to any sort of risk to uh the network itself I think the Network's very secure with um an abundance of hash rate and that hash rate is uh likely uh going to be updating and they're likely going to be pulling

00:39:02
their release from uh the corth official uh repo yes yes I think that is very likely uh for this Fork so no my my my comment about the risk is for the Future No any any um platform that has so many notes with a button that upgrades automatically I think they could certain circumstance circumstances coordinate split or or things like that so but yeah not worth continuing to talk about that hypothesis because because it's a very low risk right now does anybody have um comments about other things

00:39:49
or um block number ecip 1109 spiral the ETC cooperatives um latest order3 report or any other issues about ethereum plastic I just wanted to mention that it's quite a an interesting date because January 31st is vitalik's birthday well no it's a it's a great gift for him for sure great job thank you for all the work on spiral to the court developers yeah thank you very good and thank you very much everybody for participating thank you Diego Thank You Isaac thank you Chris thank you Bob H

00:40:47
thank you for istor and Ronin and Rola everybody who participated ask questions so this has been the BTC community call the developer call set the number for spiral it's already set then let's go until the rest of the echosystem it's block number n number 19,250 th000 estimated to happen on January 31st let's go thank you is ISAC if you can get uh ecip drafted um I'll review and get it in thanks goodbye everybody PE everyone bye bye thanks bye bye bye
