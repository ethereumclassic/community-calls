Lo welcome to ather classic Community call today is the 19th of March 2024 today we're going to be talking about the ethereum classic block gas limit uh we're currently in the ETC Discord Channel but this will be uploaded to YouTube it'll be quite a technical conversation so do feel free to jump in at any time and ask questions or request clarification or make any comment this call was prompted due to discussion on Discord about what to do about the block gas limit on ethereum classic the block gas limit is the

00:00:44
maximum amount of gas that can be used in a block as such it also limits the largest transaction size per block this includes contract deployments but contracts but complex contract deployments can also be split into multiple transactions the debate the debate was triggered by the recent last year 1 million gas limit that was inexplicably voted on by miners which caused issues for devs deploying contracts this was eventually corrected back to 8 million after coordination with miners miners are able to vote on the

00:01:19
target block gas limit over time it adjusts there's no upper limit and the lower limit is 125,000 block gas limit is notoriously tricky to get right as a small limit means that fewer and less complex contracts cont transactions can be made and too big means that chain blow can be a problem which in turn causes centralization so the debate involves on Discord four participants who have put some views forward and hopefully will be joining the call and uh expressing their positions this includes Donald McIntyre

00:01:58
who's joining us today Ronin who will hopefully join us myself and Cody Burns who also mentioned he might be able to join in their own worlds they can explain their position and if not I'll try to do so on their behalf so first would you like to take the stand on to explain your proposal for I believe fixing the gas limit yes thank you istor and thank you for the introduction um as a president the gas limit debate it's important to note that in Bitcoin in in between 2015 and 2017 there was a

00:02:43
very very serious um debate and and they call it the war the block size War um that was precisely about this it it was it was about the size of each block Bitcoin historically started I think with no set size then they discovered a bug at some some point in the history of of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto decided to um give each block a specific size of one megabyte and at the time I think his explanation was to prevent spam um and let's see what happens in the future and we're going to solve

00:03:33
whatever happens in um by by by 2015 2017 Bitcoin was much more popular everywhere in the world people were using it and people started to say okay if we keep the small block of one megabyte it only fits uh x amount of transactions I think it was like 250,000 transactions uh per block um we we're going to not going to be able to compete with visa for example that that uh they process billions of transactions per hour or per day we're going to we we're only going to uh process 20 sorry 250,000 per day um it

00:04:21
was it was around 2,000 per block something like that um but there was a group of of of so so they were saying we we need to increase the block size to 10ab 20 megabytes 30 megabytes and like that time passes by but there was a a group of maximalists who said no this this the increase in the block size basically makes the blockchain bigger the database bigger and in Time new people who will want to will want to run noes uh are going to find it impossible to download Lo the software and then synchronize

00:05:02
with the network because it's going to be so big in terms of gigabytes of information or terabytes of information in the future that um to be impossible for new people to join from especially from places with low bandwidth all bandwidths in other parts of the world and in the end the the Bitcoin is going to centralize into a few big nodes in the in the developed world where there's high band internet bandwidth and they have they have powerful Computing resources compute all the new blocks and

00:05:40
also to to create new notes and things like that uh and we're going to go back to the centralized model of banking and all that the same this same Theory applies in eum classic ethereum classic if if the blocks of ethereum classic which are every 13 seconds rather than every 10 minute um get bigger and bigger and bigger uh than um the problem of bloating bloating is this problem of the size of the of the blocks and that impacts the size of the the database itself which is going to make it practically impossible in the future for

00:06:23
people to synchronize a new node and it's going to reduce number of nodes in the network it's going to reduce also the the coverage in regions and things like that because of bandwidth because of local computing power and things like that so the the the however in in in ethereum ethereum and Etc were one network at the beginning I I am doing this like basic introduction Cas there's listeners who who don't know the background so ethereum and ethereum classic were the same blockchain in in the beginning and

00:07:00
and for some decision umal at the time they said okay we don't know what is the the the perfect block size and that applies also with bco really there's no there's no perfect block sizei Nakamoto just said one megabyte then it was modified with something called segwit that now it supports two two megabytes per block there was after that war in 2017 there was a modific ification of the of the block size um that increased it from 1 Megabyte capacity to 2 megabyte Capac it's it's a it's a technical

00:07:40
thing it remain the the important information is that it remained small and the small blockers won that war so that's a good precedent in in Bitcoin and it's a conservative way of managing the blockchain but in in the case of ethereum for some rationale at the time when it was design between 2013 and 2014 they decided that there was was not going to be a fixed or set size like in Bitcoin and that miners would decide the block size depending on the demand of block space the volume of transactions

00:08:16
that had to be handled the volume of new smart contracts or executions and that um so the model of of Etc remained like that um when when Etc and ethereum split in 2016 so now Etc is an independent chain then ethereum move to proof of stake um so they have a whole new set of problems there and it's a centralized system so so that that doesn't concern Etc anymore for the purposes of this of this topic but Etc remained with this model where the miners basically decide the block size and the block size is

00:08:57
decided by determining a gas limit no every time someone sends a transaction to to ethereum Classic they have to put a gas limit it's measured by gas and each each transaction can have a different level of complexity and and you and more or less each each transaction has a gas size and then you pay for that gas and there's a gas price um so when you said now um here classic is set to 8 million gas and that determines the block size uh in in bytes um it's more or less because um a transaction that is the same amount of

00:09:43
gas can have different bites than another one because it the transactions are more complex that this is why the the gas system was created cre a common uh a common uh quantity variable uh that would be e easy to quantify these things so the gas limit at 8 million determines a block a block size which is which has an average block size and if the block size is increased from 8 million now now it's not said 8 million it's 8 million is the default and it's where it's where it's hovering unless the miners decide

00:10:19
to change uh the miners can decide to change it for example arbitrarily in November of last year there were miners that decided to reduce it to 1 million instead of increasing the block size they reduced it nobody knows why that happened and some people were having problems sending transactions and smart contracts so we did a lot of noise on on social media and they we turn it back to 8 million which is which is where ethereum and Etc had been floating for a long time um and and and it remains now in

00:10:56
ETC like that as long as Etc doesn't have all the blocks uh filled with transactions and new smart contract deployments like that so the problem the main problem is bloating uh of that's the way I see it um and the second problem is that the miners can can change arbitrarily according to their uh business model and their biases the block size and I think that this is uh risky because in in etherium they they consistently increased the block size um from where it was the the 8 million increased it to

00:11:39
to 10 million then to 12 million by the time they were migrating to to uh proof of stake they changed it to 15 million and the ethereum blockchain is extremely bloated so I think that it's it's important for two reasons to fix the gas limit and and take away at at a certain level say 8 million I I would I would I would consider range between 8 million and 15 million 15 million gas limit per per block in order to control the size of the blockchain in the future and to control bloating and also take away from

00:12:22
miners I think that no one should have uh this this arbitrary decision uh to to change the the block size whenever they want the block size is something that is fundamental in a blockchain it determines future centralization or decentralization of the system it determines whether people can participate in other parts of the world in the blockchain or not and therefore it it it uh it um permin permissionless and sensorship resistance uh so I think uh the best uh path would be to fix to set the block

00:13:01
size at a certain gas by protocol nobody can change it except if there's a hard Fork uh in the future which is how Bitcoin is configured and I would use Bitcoin as the example blockchain because Bitcoin uh I think we can that it's the most successful blockchain and and it's the biggest one and it's the original one and it's most secure and the most aligned with um atc's philosophy of code is law I think there's a lot of Merit in what you're saying and actually agree with

00:13:37
basically all of it I think um one notable point is that the blocksize debate in Bitcoin world ended up causing a chain split and the big blockers went away on bitcoin cash if I remember correctly yes the uh the in in the end the the it it was very interesting because the great majority of people because the great majority of people in this industry don't understand things things they don't areation and permissionless distances are very difficult philosophical and principles to understand

00:14:18
mentally uh even today I observe that more than 90% of these things they only so people focus only on technical things and easy to understand commercially and business-wise topics like saying oh Visa many transactions coin two little transactions oh we have to Mo be like Visa that that kind of thinking exactly opposite of how you should think um and um um the so the great majority of people were yeah yeah let's increase coinbase zapo at the time all the all the Business Leaders at the time in 2017 of

00:15:05
bitco yeah yeah let's increase Barry silbert even Barry silbert and and they did a meeting in New York and they got 80% of the miners and the exchanges all the economic notes and and the block explorers and all the leaders and they all signed documents saying we all agreed to increase the block size and there were very few core developers of Cipher punks who really understood the thing that they they they did the excruciating work of explaining each one one by one doing meetings and everything

00:15:35
why they were wrong slowly uh they turned the tide and the majority in the end said it's a bad idea to increase the block size so a minority did split uh that they they were like a hard almost stiff necked uh uh stubborn minority who decided to to break off Bitcoin and create the Big Blocks and that's Bitcoin cash this is why I say that Bitcoin cash it's flawed doomed by Design Bitcoin cash I think they have a block size that is bigger than 32 megabytes per per and and Bitcoin SV as well and

00:16:16
they're totally bloated and uh they're broken they're broken by Design they cannot scale uh without being centralized it's more or less like proof of stake proof of stake it's it's centralized at scale and big block proof of work blockchains are also centralized at scale but they did break away and they were a minority at the time yeah that's right and I think a a point that is not made enough during that debate is that the one of the main disadvantages of changing the block size

00:16:50
once is that you open the door to doing it again and again in the future which is exactly what happened with Bitcoin cash right once you start making changes like this the protocol is no longer aifi and it is under the control of some social group that have decided to change it and once they've done it once they've kind of captured that chain and can do it again in the future if they want so having a commitment to rific on a political level makes it more difficult to change things in the future

00:17:19
which is really what the goal should be to avoid capture um hi guys um I wanted to add something else to this discussion and maybe the comparation between uh Bitcoin and etherium in this case is not fair enough um and I think that because uh the block size in Bitcoin only represents uh like uh size and in in ethereum it also represents computation and that's a a main differ because uh in in many cases the the this ability uh to reduce the block size through a a mechanism from from the miners to to vote to to reduce the size

00:18:07
of block has been useful and and a protection for the network uh there there were some cases and it could and we may have the same situation in the in the future when uh some vulnerability has been discovered on the protocol or the or or the implementations of the of the op codes or or something that where uh for for like like uh pennies uh people could attack the network like creating big uh full um blocks which are really really hard to process for the whole network so in those cases the protection was to ask

00:18:47
the miners to reduce the the block size and that was a like like a temporary solution up until the developers were able to fix the thing and to release new new versions and and that process is way faster than coordinating a new release asking everybody to upgrade and make us uh to develop the the solutions and testing and all of that could take weeks uh while changing the the gas limit for for miners could take like a few hours at tops so I think that's that's one point for me to to keep the

00:19:27
current um the current mechanism um I think we can increase the the the the current default gas limit I don't think that will be a huge problem if we don't go mad with with a number I think some number as as Donald said between eight and 15 million may be reasonable we should run some testing on how that will affect the network but I think we could be okay with that uh but changing the overall mechanism I think it's a it's it's not a great idea also there is also some other point that it might be

00:20:02
important that I think it's important that the the protocol or the network survives the developers so there will be some point where the de I mean we are now in like in the developers age but there will be some point where the protocol and the the whole network will be aifi and nobody will need us and that will be like the the like like the heaven for for the network when there will be no developers involved on this so at that time we cannot ask anybody to change these kind of things in in in

00:20:33
attack situations or maybe in in a high demand situations or many other situations so I think that's also important that which can be managed outside the the the protocol itself should be managed outside from the the protocol itself um so well that those were my my two points that we're thinking about all this yeah these are points I also agree with I generally think the gas voting mechanism is a pretty good solution although maybe not perfect because it avoids the hardfork problem to change the limit and reduces

00:21:09
the chain split potential in future like uh we don't know future Hardware advancements or transaction types or potential vulnerabilities that might need the limit to change and having this voting mechanism provides this uh in a kind of elegant way to to manage that limit um whilst maintaining protocol alific if it needs to change in the future given that they could change it anyway at any point by Harding this just means they have a a way to mediate that process without causing a chain split so I will continue by as ronian is

00:21:55
not here I will put forward his uh position and just read out what he posted on Discord to provide a counter balance to uh the the current debate so Ronan observes that the 8 million gas limit is a drastic restriction for the 2024 application development standard currently most development teams are operating at around a 30 million gas limit therefore the 8 million gas limit is restricting the smart contracts that can be deployed to ethereum Classic leaving it as a disadvantage to other evm networks like s Foundation which is

00:22:31
the evm ETC aims to maintain protocol parity with to remain state of the art protocol par logic states that we are trying to provide a similar development environment with the F foundation for debt development in the application environment we have Min minimal differences notable are EIP 15 F9 that was excluded due to its impact on the fixed monetary Supply however we have a voluntary difference of 8 million gas limit versus a 30 million gas limit on E this restricts the the smart contracts that can be deployed to the network

00:23:01
current evm application ecosystem is developing around 30 million gas limit if the goal is for applications on E to easily migrate to Etc due to protocol parity it's logical for the glass limit to be the same different effects contract size reoccurring calls deployment scripts and more oh hey Ronin you just appeared as as reading your position I'll finish it off and then maybe you can uh add some as I just wrap up here so how to adjust current method is social consensus then alerting the mining ecosystem change

00:23:37
does not require a hard Fork it's merely social likely needs to be documented SL justified in the ecip process once changed should take about two days for gas limit to raise from 8 million to 30 million rationale this allows the application layer to grow and support more complex contracts like Advanced lending borrowing protocols allows 2024 state-ofthe-art application to be deployed to Etc this should help produce a lucrative free fee market for Miners and earn more than the chain emissions

00:24:08
also this should allow Etc to gain intellectual human capital in the bare application space enables chain agnostic evm development with the largest application layer evm Community a big outside hey sorry about that I thought uh I thought this started in 30 minutes so I must have been off have you guys been on for since six or for about 20 minutes yeah we started at uh 1200 UTC oh I see I see sorry uh daylight savings stuff um anyway so so uh so I guess uh listen I don't have the solution here I uh my real interest in

00:24:52
this is that I'm seeing this as an observed um issue when I talk to the application layer uh space so dap developers and such and uh and big integration Partners uh or like uh infrastructure Partners like um price Oracle feeds uh bridging um a lot of this uh stuff when you're connecting EVMS and and talking about uh an interoperable evm ecosystem um it's it's a pain point because no other network is that low on gas um and so that's really the the concern there and so the default that

00:25:38
most Builders accept uh right now is the 30 million gas limit on eth Main net um but other chains have higher gas limits and and all sorts of stuff um but really my interest is more on the friction that's created from this um I ALS Al understand uh the concept uh that um this could create blockchain blow uh you know are we always going to uh follow eth mainnet uh every time they adjust the gas those type of uh questions um my specific uh perspective right now is just trying to get uh ethereum classic the evm up to date to

00:26:26
2024 um so it can capitalize on it's hash rate and Security in the application space so um so that's really where I'm coming from outside of um any sort of thing of like hey I want to set a a hard rule of that we always do this or or um or we need to fix the gas limit or anything like that I think those are much more complex uh conversations because I think we would all agree that um the current current method of just the miners really decide whatever they want uh um is kind of kicking the can of

00:27:06
of the gas limit in the long term um but just in the short term and specifically uh where ethereum classic is today where the DAP ecosystem is today um the 30 million gas limit is the industry norm and best practices and not every contract hits that um but what we're seeing is that um as you get into more sophisticated or or just more evolved um protocols when you move from the V1 protocols into the V3 version protocols the contracts get bigger and that's where we run into issues so if we're trying to set up the

00:27:47
composable DAP Eco uh uh infrastructure for um a robust um uh dap environment to thrive on classic uh we need to think about that of okay if we want 2024 protocols on classic um we likely need to at least consider uh matching the eth gas limit because that's what most people are developing to um I don't I I just to clarify I'm not saying we should always follow eth it's just specifically because we are trying to catch up to eth and trying to gain those uh those dap developers and all of that and um and a

00:28:28
lot of Protocols are uh set up in a way that they function like it's a three a 30 million gas limit and that's not just contract deployment it's also reoccurring calls like um for instance a multi-chain call right so so you have you can you can adjust uh the size of that so that's something that's probably less uh burdensome but also um deployment scripts right uh you'd have to rewrite all the deployment scripts and so it's just it's just those type of things that I think uh are important to

00:29:03
have on the radar um as we have this conversation yeah thanks for that and I totally uh appreciate both your and Donald's position here I think they have a lot of Merit like obviously previously I used to support super low gas limit for the reasons that Donald mentioned before at the same time you are right and as a contract developer I definitely see the Y usefulness of being able to like migrate code easily and not having to rewrite stuff just to use with Etc feel like that would be a massive loss

00:29:38
in terms of utility for the network and it also May limit future L2 technology if large proofs can't be published to Etc my main problem however is that increasing the block gas limit seems like a very blunt force means to solve the problem cuz really we just want to be able to enable some transactions that are really big to go through without bloating the chain and I think there might be a potential for us to come up with a solution that allows us to have big transactions whilst also not increasing bloat and that would mean

00:30:16
somehow having transactions that go uh having some kind of gas credit for example that allow them to either mine some kind of token in the future sorry mind like a native gas token for example that can be used in transactions or some kind of dynamic mechanism that allows future gas to be used in a current block so that bloke doesn't increase but complex contract cont complex transactions and contracts can be used and that is like a big complicated change I know but I think it's the only solution that satisfies

00:30:51
both um developer adoption concerns and the uh loo concerns that over raised yeah I think that I think that's a great point of uh you know where we don't want the 30 million gas limit for all transactions all the time right it's it's regarding specific type of uh contracts that you're trying to put online it's not uh oh every block should be 30 million guests um if that's plausible in some sort of way uh that'd be great um even if it was like oh at the I mean the way it's adjusted right

00:31:33
now is so manual in the sense that miners just s adjust the fee even if it was oh at the beginning of the month two days you get uh you get to deploy a 30 million uh gas limit contract so that anyone that had the big stuff they know every 12 times a year they have an opportunity to deploy it to main that um something like that I know that that's that's not uh feasible but I'm just trying to hide highlight that uh I do agree with you that um you know for most blocks you will not need a 30 million

00:32:05
gas limit right it it it's it's unnecessary it's really for very specific protocols to get online uh that will help improve the fun or increase the functionality and utility of the evm so um the need of the 30 million gas is for for specific actions that are deployment of certain contracts yeah so what what we're seeing is we're seeing uh you know very early contracts like a uniswap V2 let's just use that as an example very light contract doesn't have complex logic or

00:32:49
anything like that so that one uh pretty easy to deploy on this network um we did Unis swap V3 um that was gener fine in terms of deployment um in some of the operation we had to adjust it because it uh its logic was built around the 30 million gas limit but at the end of the day that ended up not being too big of a lift or anything uh we had that resolved you know you know once we identified it fairly quickly um but as you get into some more complex uh lending and borrowing protocols and the evolution in

00:33:24
that type of space we're starting to see people struggle to get into the 30 million gas limit uh because they have complex contracts so um a prime example that I identified was while at eth Denver was um uh a company called curat they're launching right now and they're struggling to get under the 30 million so that's just an example of how the application layer is evolving to start hitting the limits of a 30 million uh G limit contract and uh anyways it's it's just I think the the Highlight the

00:34:04
difference here is um are we trying to if are we are we trying to have friction where the application layer space everyone including if we want to do uh price Oracle integration bridging integration every single element um if we want them all to look at Classic and go okay we all we have to do custom engineering time to add anything into that Network so we're going to put it on the back burner because it's going to cost us way more than any other n evm to deploy and then when we get around to it

00:34:38
uh we'll add support for ETC um so that's kind of the Dilemma that happens when we have this low gas limit um and that's the problem that's the friction so do we want the friction there uh or do we want to resolve that and uh if we resolve it is it a dynamic way of what a stor is talking about or is it simply um asking the miners to raise the limit um is there social consensus for that those are those are kind of all the things but right now um in integration talks when I mention hey the gas limits only 8

00:35:14
million every single team goes oo is I'm gonna now I'm gonna have to adjust our deployment script now I have to look at every single contract and see what is hitting over that eight uh eight million limit it's not like it's 20 million right it's 8 million so that's substantially lower than 30 million um so so you run into it all over the place and then you know you wonder oh why isn't Etc um integrated in all of this dap ecosystem and and and that's the friction right there engineering time is

00:35:46
expensive so um so that's really the case for it of of thinking about the logic of we're maintaining protocol parity with eth main net so that the DAP ecosystem can easily Thrive between the two yet we're restricting voluntarily deployment and we're making it all custom compared to making it similar we we always say oh all the code you don't have to adjust it at all that is 100% not true based on the gas limit and I actually see a big opportunity of enabling developers to deploy contracts that they can't on

00:36:25
ethereum mainnet to ethereum Classic because of this potential even though it might be super expensive to call that transaction to deploy but if there's no upper or a much higher individual TX limit but uh overall no increase in bloat then it seems like it's a win-win and you'll have new projects that um are waiting for Earth to increase the gas limit or can't deploy and need to optimize deploying to Etc instead sorry are you are you speaking in the dynamic sense of of where smart

00:37:11
contracts have a different a different limit versus transactions I I would say like any any transaction if people are willing to pay a massive amount of gas at some uh some higher price than they normally would then as long as it's not increasing bloat overall it seems like a win to enable that even if it's larger than the block gas limit sorry Chris did you want to jump in yeah I'm not against uh changing uh the gas limit here but uh for doing that I would like to do some research and it

00:37:54
seems that uh you might know up front uh on my questions like uh Ronin if I'm correct uh you mentioned a contact uh that you found at Denver at Denver which was called Curve something I wasn't able to hear it correctly so I would like to find out uh actual use cases actual contracts that cannot be deployed uh because of uh the requirement of having a lot of gas uh the reason for that that is that uh I was in belief that uh by changing that limit it had on ethereum specifically to 30 million it

00:38:40
was for two reasons one for handling more transactions and two for handling uh transactions with a bigger size with regards layer to transactions and blob transactions and all of that uh so not for just an individual deploy transaction so I don't think this is a limitation but I would like to to find if it is and work on that next to that uh on the having a fixed gas limit on the protocol I think I don't like this idea uh one thing that uh could be discussed is to have minimum and maximum cap

00:39:30
defined uh so as miners cannot go crazy and set it 1 million yeah that's that makes sense but make this fixed in the protocol uh creates new new new problems uh with regards some things and last of it um having 30 million or 20 uh uh changes some Dynamics as well like centralization if we have blow of SE transactions that come into the network and not as isor mentioned of having u a requirement of bigger price to pay bigger price uh for uh huge transactions then uh the CH the size will be bloated

00:40:29
and this would mean that uh the ciz we will have more calization because we will not be able to have a lot of users running full nodes so at the end you have less full nodes and you have more centralization then uh of course the we we have to manage the the blo in size and see what to do with that and uh we are not sure about how the gas price will be changed with regard to the markets not that it is an issue right now on ITC but in in general idea so first I would like to see uh contracts that have the requirement to

00:41:15
do that and uh the last thing uh not I said that the previous was the last thing but uh I'm not sure if you are able already to do a transaction with more gas gas than the limit I think you might be able to do that with transaction version two and in if this is possible then the miner the miners will be able to see in the their transaction pools that okay how someone has this requirement and if I change my gas limit a bit up then I will pick up that block and win so at the end it's a win-win situation but I have to research

00:42:01
that because it has been a long time that I tried to send a bigger transaction to the network um there is also another Point uh regarding the comparation about the 30 million that ethereum has and the 8 million that we have is that uh ethereum has the 1559 enabl so they have an incentive uh on the on the grass price to uh to make blocks uh half full so when when the block starts like getting really full the gas price the base fee as they call uh starts increasing almost exponentially in some some way of

00:42:43
exponential growth so that makes that um people will try to keep the the prices pretty lower um and trying to reach not full logs so that's something that that allows them to play with the 30 million uh gas limit blocks so that's something that they have we don't uh including some sort of 1559 on EDC it's something that uh we were talking about we are try we are researching um if that will fit Etc well I mean the idea will be to do the same mechanisms without the the burning Fe that the 1559 has in in E

00:43:26
and ethereum but um that's also something worth to mention I think uh it's it's not as simple as as just Rising it to to 30 million without that mechanism right was um I did look into 1559 at one point and I believe there was something unique to ethereum that made it not really compatible with Etc am I remembering that right I think the main difference there I mean or the the main problem that we will have for integrated indc is that they will burn the the base fee so as we have a fixed monetary policy we can do

00:44:10
that but uh for the other feature that's see the the other transactions where it's mandated to to pay at least the base fee defined by the network I suspect that we can include that but it's something that under research okay but they would still have Fally you had s sorry there's a bit of lag on this one um they they would still fundamentally have the same issues in terms of overall bloat they're just kind of incentivizing the averaging out of transaction fees really is that

00:44:49
right yes M yes but but they have another mechanism that we don't have right now just this Inc incentive to to keep the the blocks at the half size and then as stora you had mentioned I didn't even think about this but uh in terms of the rollups uh when we start getting into a scaling debate of how this gas limit plays into that um I I technically don't uh don't know much about um the settlement and how the rollup settles settles down on L1 and uh and its size and everything like that I

00:45:31
know um in the recent uh update on eth Main net um they're putting in scaffold te for Proto dank sharding and things like that and then there was some stuff about uh L1 or L L2 settlement on L1 so um that's definitely something to add into the mix of this uh and just so just so I'm clear um to you guys I don't have the answer for this I'm glad we're talking about the security concerns and everything I think it's really important that we have a very detailed conversation about this before any

00:46:04
action happens because um as you can see there's there's a lot of ramifications when you uh mess around with the gas yeah totally I see this as the first explor exploration into the topic and uh as it's been brought up on Discord it's just nice to have some uh focused conversation on it and there's still lots of ideas of what could be done um looking forward to hear about Cody's Dynamic block idea um maybe it's similar to what I've been talking about but I think um ideally we can find a

00:46:44
solution that is finding the best tradeoffs available um um it feels like just a simple increase of block size whilst simple isn't really getting to uh a situation that satisfies everyone um definitely on Donald's side having a having no bloat I think is a really important thing or as minimal as possible um but at the same time yeah having having that uh adoption from developers is also essential so really trying to find a solution that can solve both of those I think with enough thought could be something we can

00:47:26
achieve yeah and I'm I'm uh kind of in the same uh place as Chris was saying earlier of I'm not really uh into arbitrary limits uh just fixing things just because we're gonna we just decide right now um I think the concern with that is you don't know what things will look like in the future um and having a hard rule like that is only going to to create a contentious environment when it becomes uh a problem for the network um you know someone will come back and say oh well those people on that call set that

00:48:10
random arbitrary number of oh I think 15 million is the max we should ever do um we have no proof that 15 million is great for the life of this network at all so I think I think hard rules like that uh probably aren't great I I think an approach uh of a Dynam Dynamic approach where you uh maybe treat smart contract deployment that uh a little bit different than just everyday transaction makes a lot of sense um because uh as as you were mentioning uh you know that uh that doesn't contribute to blockchain

00:48:47
bloat um and then and bring in some of uh the concerns with uh uh centralization due to such a big blockchain and people can't run uh a full Noe and everything so um so anyways I just I don't think that just a hard rule of oh let's just fix it to any arbitrary number makes a lot of sense I think with 1 million gas limit which was already attempted to do uh that would make no sense today so that's a prime example of how a hard rule today probably won't make sense in five years

00:49:19
from now um and then and then this network has a long life ahead of it and so any of these hard rules uh likely will be obsolete in five years a decade from now definitely in 20 years the the problem is loo one side that's that's the Restriction the physical restriction that that um that we are facing no the physical restriction of of bloat because it creates ation future um yeah the second one the secondary one is whether we have group of humans objectively saying okay now block up now block down now block up

00:50:12
like that I think that's we have to eliminate subjectivity um protocol I understand and I agree with everybody sorry can I jump in Donald because I feel like in a way because it's minors that are voting with their hash rate it's only as subjective as the actual consensus mechanism itself so I don't I don't see where the extra subjectivity is coming from it is that there's a group of humans deciding the block size um time to time um but yes they have to do it within the rules of the

00:50:54
protocol and um and they the uh I think it's what Diego said that that when whenever there's a problem it's useful to be able to manipulate manually the block size solve the problem while we go while we solve the the bug or whatever it is to then opgrade in the future it's a good shortterm way of um solving problem so I I I understand that I also appreciate that Ronin Ronin said we don't know what is the perfect block size that that's true like I said before in Bitcoin they don't know what is the

00:51:37
perfect block size so that that's something that we may never know we don't know what what bandwidths and Computing capacity are going to be in different parts of the world and what's what are the optimals to make the workor as decentralized as possible so we have these uncertainties um and I I also understand that we need need to adapt to the evm standard and to normal Market practices because if everybody's deploying Mark contracts at demand higher gas limit get get left out of the market and

00:52:21
that is also not a good situation to be in so this is is the this is the general problem I I understand that maybe fixing the the gas block to a number like 8 million or 12 million or 15 million or 20 or 30 um may bring new problems so maybe put a I I think somebody mentioned a minimum now the minimum is 125k a minimum of four maximum of 20 and that the miners can uh wiggle within that range I'm open to studying those things I don't have a closed opinion or anything like that the situation

00:53:12
yet yeah I think it I think it's great I think we we're all pretty open-minded here um in in the sense of I think we're we're starting to look at all of the issues around this gas uh gas limit and um and and I think that's a good point to bring up Donald of in the long run we definitely do not want uh uh humans to just be arbitrarily adjusting things for the network um especially with you know um a as the network continues to grow um you don't want that centralized body there that's exactly what we're trying

00:53:46
to get away from it's clear that uh the current um setup with the gas uh is is really uh just temporary right um I don't think anyone wants oh the miners can just arbitrarily change uh the gas to whatever they want uh I don't think that that's that's a great model for the long term but um uh great point on the uh on the social element there of trying to remove uh the human the humans uh input in the long run I mean whilst I can understand why putting the additional sort of barrier

00:54:29
to miners of having them need to do a hard Fork to change the gas price sorry the g the block gas limit I don't see it as being a fundamental like preventative measure if the if the miners wanted to coordinate socially and say hey we're going to change the gas limit to this new limit all they have to do is tweak one variable and start mining that chain so fundamentally it's still in their control and I see the voting mechanism more as a way to allow them to come to an agreement on what the

00:55:07
gas limit should be without risking a chain split so I I mean I can see the point of making it more difficult but I don't really see how it fundamentally changes the situation that currently exists well I would say I I don't want I don't want to turn this into a debate because again we are in a good point right now studying this I think what what Chris said uh that we need to do the research and and be very smart about whatever what we decide in the future about the gas the gas limit but U regarding the you just said

00:55:52
isor there's no equivalence between having a guy like guys changing the gas limit very easily like they changed it last November from 8 million to 1 million rest couldn't uh deploy contract they were wrting here that's extremely easy to do even by one mining pool that has 30% of the mining pool share very easy for them just to guide the the block size up or down versus doing a hard fork and and coordinating is not exactly the this is why proof of work blockchains are so and not only that

00:56:36
people can split anyway from arrary hard Forks that that special interest groups want to say so there there's no equivalence uh saying miners have the power anyway so this means that in Bitcoin you can you can change the mon AR policy whenever you want that's also true it's extremely difficult um there's no equivalence between one or the other meth I can see your point sorry go ahead Chris yeah I the time that it happened to that Miner was able to manipulate the gas limit 1 million he had more than 30% of

00:57:26
the G rate I think but uh yeah it's true it can happen for this reason I think we can set a minimum cap or requirement not in consensus but I mean in in the clients so if somebody wants to modify uh that value in the code itself and do it then it will work it's not a contentious rule but uh yeah in CL we can have some even warnings or not allow having this cap below 4 million 6 million I don't know but we can set that I mean uh probably the reason that uh they have done that was because they didn't

00:58:16
knew what will come yeah my theory is that there was probably some misconfigured default like some tutorial or some software update that was pushed by one of these po softwares that just automatically set 1 million and no one really thought about it no one intentionally did it they just used the defaults of this update indeed uh yeah and to to clarify in in core gu uh the default is 30 million correct or or is is the default set to 8 million uh for Etc uh on the next release it will be uh 8 million the pl has already merged uh but

00:59:05
in this m at this moment it's 30 million yes and this came uh during merging the Upstream changes while back yeah I also noticed on uh in in can you guys do a PR where uh you guys update um the Mordor uh Network so that it also matches um main net because the m one is 30 million as well and with that one there's such little hash rate that's actually securing Mordor that um you know I if if I turn off my minor for instance uh it goes up to 30 million so um so it creates an environment where we

00:59:41
have a test net that has the eth main net gas limit and then uh we have a main net that has our own gas limit so that that'd be good to just have consistency between those two networks and have the um the actual limit enforced as the default I will share uh a link in community calls right now it's about PR 620 620 and it says 8 million gas for both classing and M and this has been merged into Master two weeks ago oh awesome okay thank you so much for doing that uh it's definitely something I I've noticed over on uh on

01:00:22
the Mordor Network while deploying sorry for missing out uh while merging that this was coming in the 30 million I mean uh seems like it wasn't an issue as we're at 8 mil and it seems like mostly it's the mining po config that controls that so I guess it was something on their end that they just didn't think about so I'm not sure yeah anyway it it's uh a debate that's kind of tangental towards the main topic about what we can do um so for the next stages of this uh discussion I guess we can

01:01:10
maybe I can try and put together a list of all the potential outcomes uh all the suggestions that have been made in this call and try and figure out the uh the benefits and drawbacks of each one and maybe compile the arguments that have been uh set forth and then we can think about what makes the most sense going forward that's great uh please guys if anyone knows a codra that is needs uh more gas during deployment please let us know uh Chris I did oh sorry go ahead clarify regarding that current 8

01:01:58
million limit is is is really it's not set by us or the protocol or anything like that just just the miners are are following the defaults it could be increased to 30 million couple of days very easily by them so um that that's a a mar a free market thing that is happening right now it's not it's not Etc that is restricted or that the miners that just uh have it there if if if there's developers wanting to deploy something that they need a 30 million gas limit maybe they could on social media um F2

01:02:38
pool and the other mining pools to increase it right and I should I should clarify that uh while I have ran into contracts that are hitting that 30 million limit it's usually stuff that's being developed now you know in 2024 2023 so a lot of the older contracts uh are not hitting those limits some of their operations need to get adjusted but that's immaterial stuff uh this conversation was uh really uh formed by me just thinking about how people developing today and uh and how they're

01:03:15
developing around that 30 million so it's not like it's a complete blocker for us to get some of the infrastructure online it is a little bit uh more expensive because it's different engineering time for integration uh last thing go on no it's another another last topic that I want to say but if you have a comment about this yeah with regards to this uh I would think that uh for this new type of contracts that are being worked now we have to do with blob transactions and Layer Two So currently

01:03:52
we don't have uh on our ecosystem don't have a layer to uh that is that will use such features so uh at the moment I don't see this as an issue and uh I'm not sure with not about the the full technology and what we support for this we have to be in parity and then allow the developers to come in and build on that but about the gas limit I don't think that we have to to already fulfill uh the 30 million so as they feel that okay yeah Etc is a good Network to go but first they have

01:04:40
to to display that yeah we start building on it so let's start the discussion on uh increasing that limit uh because we want to make use of it uh but this is just my two cents and I'm open to dis some that yeah I just thought of another conversation I'm uh I'm in in works with layer zero which is a pretty material bridge and uh and the 8 million gas limit came up there as well um so uh just just another example of of a contract or a a team that uh has cited issues with the 8 million

01:05:21
MH I was going to say is that if if the 30 million is really needed every now and then it would be great if we have a small block fa and that's that's the network usually operates and then someone says okay I need one big block for this they pay an exorbitant fee it would be great if the protocol could allow that we don't have to exclude these people they have to pay for like you said this outside the outside of a limit that would be another thing to study I think isor mentioned that and was one

01:06:00
of his suggestions yeah that would be good I I don't think it's possible but what I studied about the protocol that you have the gas limit the next block can be only as big as 1,4 uh of the previous block so you cannot only pay just come and pay a big fee and you have a 50 megabyte block no I don't think so I don't think that is allowed yet in thisbe allow the miners have to change their values it takes one to two days for these two to change on the network and then they can submit the transaction

01:06:46
yeah I I assume it would require a hard if you guys want to play around with this uh go into Mordor there's there's it's pretty low hash rate there so if you turn on some hash rate you'll be able to play with adjusting the gas limit to see kind of how the network reacts and everything and it's as Donald mentioned of of its a it's a scale and it it would take around two days you know to climb up because it just keeps building on uh what was the previous gas limit okay we can only raise it a

01:07:16
certain number so if you produce more blocks then you can raise it uh and and I think that's a stor point of um how hash rate is really determined mining the consensus on that yeah and the proposal to allow certain either like a oneoff block I mean the simplest thing would be to have like every 100 blocks you have a huge block um that would not cause all blocks to be huge um that would be the most simple implementation but I guess it would be better to have more of a dynamic system where you only get the big block when

01:07:53
it's needed and that would require uh I mean both those things would require a hard fork for sure because it doesn't adhere to the scaling strategy that's currently in use excellent thank you st for organizing this it's amazing that we have this debate yeah thanks for the great combo guys uh it's nice nice to see us start thinking about uh where we're going with Classic on the protocol level hopefully aifi but there's just minor tweaks that are still still need to be worked

01:08:30
out yep we're getting closer and unless there's any final comments that one of you made we can wrap this up I'll leave the floor open yeah thank you guys thank you guys for being here and for starting that yeah it's a great way forward for the protocol awesome so I hope we can have another conversation in the not too distant future I'll try and put together some uh notes on this meeting and condense some potential path forward so I'd like to once again say thank you everyone for joining

01:09:07
and Stay classy see you soon bye-bye see you soon byebye thank you guys
