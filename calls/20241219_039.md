## Call 039 — Transcript

[00:00:01] okay hello and welcome to etherum Classic Community call number 39 it's been a while since I last call about 9
[00:00:07] months but we thought we'd have a uh bit of a catch up for 2024 at the end of the
[00:00:12] year to see what's going on looking forward to the next year in ETC we have a few topics this week to
[00:00:19] chat about including the ETC Co-op updates the ambassador program and
[00:00:26] Devcon 7 Reflections so um this call is being recorded and will be
[00:00:32] on YouTube and if anyone wants to jump in and discuss the topic feel free to do
[00:00:37] so so we'll start off with the Ambassador sorry the ETC Co-op update
[00:00:43] which was uh an article posted by Bob summer will uh last week I believe titled
[00:00:49] Staffing changes and Q2 and Q3 reports which can be found on the ETC cor
[00:00:55] website uh the tldr is that basically Bob is is uh announcing his
[00:01:02] departure as the Director of the ETC Cooperative a role which he held since January 2019 so that's 5 years of uh
[00:01:10] excellent service by Bob so thanks to him for for that Dedication that has
[00:01:15] been uh contributed to Etc project and uh he will be missed from
[00:01:22] the uh Etc C I guess and we'll see how things
[00:01:28] progress uh without Bob but we'll uh surely have a bright future
[00:01:34] nonetheless for the etherum classic project so additionally in that post it was
[00:01:41] mentioned that there is a remaining runway for ETC Co-op of about 3 years I
[00:01:46] believe so 2027 uh September at current market rates of Runway which is about 2 million
[00:01:53] USD I believe and also there's a number of um
[00:01:59] other people leaving Etc Co-op including I believe uh Donald McIntyre who's on
[00:02:05] this call and some other members of the ET Co-op which leaves a couple of core
[00:02:12] developers remaining as fulltime so Donald as you're here
[00:02:21] um did I get that right and do you have any thing to add to the uh discussion
[00:02:26] that we can start talking about yeah yes you get you get you got
[00:02:31] um that right and uh in particular my last day at the ETC Cooperative is
[00:02:39] December 31st so it's another 10 or 12 days and
[00:02:44] [Music] um the ETC Cooperative Bob had told us
[00:02:51] in um February of March of 2024 that that that that the funds were
[00:02:58] depleting and the the The Cooperative had a a large donation
[00:03:07] from uh grayscale during 2021 during the 2021 20222 bull
[00:03:16] market um because the donations were in ETC so they they they translated into
[00:03:23] into larger and larger amount number amounts of M of dollars and um it was $5
[00:03:29] million when and and the ETC corporate have been have been living of that money
[00:03:34] and it came to a point at the beginning of 2024 where they they were starting to think okay this money we're continuing
[00:03:41] to burn it so at some point we're going to have to reduce the stop so it's not something that was sudden or unplanned
[00:03:49] it was part of the plan no and um in the last quarter then Bob told us that a
[00:03:57] rational move would be to start reducing some of the activities were that were not
[00:04:03] core um so editorial of course had to go
[00:04:08] and marketing was reduced to to 50% to
[00:04:15] part-time um back office and administrative to to
[00:04:21] part-time um then social media tweet and all that um was was uh cut
[00:04:30] and also no more events so the two people that were um always working on
[00:04:36] the events the the proof of work Summits 2023 and 2024 after the proof of work
[00:04:42] Summit they were cut as well um so I I think it's it's just a rational the
[00:04:48] almost good management of the of the of the money of the ATC um cooperative and
[00:04:54] I I in my per personal opinion my particular case I always knew that it tutorial in any organization is
[00:05:02] something that you have to cut first if you're short of money know you have to keep doing your your main product in any
[00:05:09] Corporation or in a nonprofit you have to provide your main
[00:05:14] service um so I was I it was perfectly all right the only the only difference
[00:05:20] that is that actually Bob he decided to to also leave the co-op that that's
[00:05:27] that that's the real um thing that was unplanned and and uh
[00:05:33] and that this is something personal of Bob it is true he he's right I mean um
[00:05:39] the the cost of the executive director himself is is very high the board they don't they don't get any income so um
[00:05:48] but the executive director is also a cost for the ETC Cooperative so his departure is going to reduce the the the
[00:05:56] burn rate uh significantly as well and and so we had reduced the burn rate from
[00:06:02] 150,000 to 100,000 and when I leave Bob leaves and
[00:06:08] and and everything is is is reduced to its minimum expression in January the
[00:06:13] the burn rate is going to be reduced to 75,000 so so that's where what you say
[00:06:21] isor um is true with with the $2 million
[00:06:26] uh that are left a little bit more than $2 million uh at a burn rate of
[00:06:33] 75,000 th000 I think we have um let me
[00:06:39] see 28 to 30 months of Runway I see and that's based on the the
[00:06:46] current Etc price which of course may go up or down yeah that that's based on a
[00:06:53] conservative price of 25 but okay yeah when it went up to when
[00:06:58] it went up to 40 like a few weeks ago we were like
[00:07:04] okay the money is all back we come we can come back and and and this
[00:07:11] is going to 100 and then 200 and then a thousand um but um but uh no the the
[00:07:19] approach is conservative now it's down to 29 so yeah it the taking into account
[00:07:25] ET the 67,000 Etc that um Etc Cooper operative
[00:07:30] holds um plus the cash at 20 at the ETC at 25 we have 28 to 30 months of Runway
[00:07:39] currently I see I see and basically when you say um I guess core maintenance that
[00:07:45] would be developers and I guess some basic
[00:07:52] management yes but not the the the core the purpose of the ATC Cooperative is is
[00:07:59] very well defined um and the the the people in charge now are the board of the ATC
[00:08:05] Cooperative no when now obob is in charge until October 31st but the the
[00:08:11] the people in charge of making the decisions of the of how the ETC cooperative and how it's going to look
[00:08:17] like and the shape and what's going to do are the board of directors who are
[00:08:23] Elaine o Roy Zoo uh Cody Burns and Craig Sal no craon
[00:08:30] works for um grayscale uh and they have very clear
[00:08:36] that there that the the purpose of the ETC Cooperative is to maintain the protocol base protocol of Etc that's the
[00:08:44] most fundamental thing activity I think in in in the in the whole ecosystem then
[00:08:50] to maintain the client itself the the client is core gu and then um to
[00:08:56] maintain the most basic infrastructure that some other people do but the ETC
[00:09:02] Cooperative does at least uh three things that are very important one one is to maintain the ETC
[00:09:11] block Scout instance as the main block Explorer then it has the end point that
[00:09:18] it it delegated to rivet and it pays rivet uh and it's the most important endpoint everybody uses that
[00:09:25] endpoint uh so that wallets Etc when they when they need to send transac or check balances Etc they usually use that
[00:09:33] endpoint and then they have ATC Cooperative is running four enormous
[00:09:38] notes of Etc uh that they that they serve of boot notes and they also connect with
[00:09:46] thousands of peers um so they they they serve to to
[00:09:51] provide a lot of information for example for example the ETC nodes
[00:09:57] website information comes from those four notes to be able to identify all the noes and count them Etc so we know
[00:10:04] that we have 4,000 noes 6,000 noes at every at any time we know how many notes are operating in ETC because of those
[00:10:10] four notes and and then there's a layer of communications no that's why I was doing editorial and there's a marketing
[00:10:17] person still working at the ETC cooperative and it's going to be communicating minimal going to going to
[00:10:25] do minimal Communications um work in my case when I was working at the ETC
[00:10:30] Cooperative my mission was to communicate how amazing Etc is to the world
[00:10:37] no um but now that's going to be transformed into minimal
[00:10:43] Communications right understood yeah there's a number of um I guess infrastructure projects technology that
[00:10:50] is under the umbrella of Etc co-op in terms of Maintenance and deployment
[00:10:56] ongoing um that would also include the the catacomb wallet and uh as you
[00:11:03] mentioned the river and block Scout stuff so uh with this extended Runway um
[00:11:10] or I guess whether it's extended or not uh or just like streamlined um funding
[00:11:18] program then those Services have a a longer guaranteed uh yeah funding
[00:11:24] mechanism yeah the the the the everything that is basic
[00:11:30] infrastructure is going to continue that's the priority no so as as funds go
[00:11:37] diminishing we're going to keep cutting because because what we want to what we
[00:11:42] want to provide is or what they want to provide is protocol maintenance to be on
[00:11:47] par with with um ethereum and the client itself so that people can run the node
[00:11:53] and then the basic infrastructure so that that that's going to be um
[00:11:59] the the highest priority
[00:12:06] right cool so ENT the current state then is that we're going to migrate to that
[00:12:11] smaller team in January and the organization is going to stay on in that
[00:12:17] mode for the foreseeable future understood and is the I I guess
[00:12:25] there's probably uh discussions going on about leadership and whether there'll be
[00:12:30] a new director or how that's going to go but whether it's public or not if it's
[00:12:36] uh TBD I would I would guess yes it's it's not public the board
[00:12:43] is is deciding how they're going to organize the team and who's going to lead and um and things like that details
[00:12:51] like that I think um the deadline to to to define the the the the final
[00:12:59] structure of the ETC Cooperative is going to be January 31st okay that those are all it's more
[00:13:06] like housekeeping in terms of infrastructure and priorities the money is there I mean this is something that
[00:13:12] that I told uh them that we're not in a panic mode that
[00:13:19] like a startup I I've been in many startup I had my own startups I had four startups and I have run out of money
[00:13:25] with my startups and and you are in a panic mode because you're running out of money in 30 days uh so you need to see
[00:13:32] how you're going to pay your salaries you're going to fire the the staff they all the severance payments
[00:13:39] taxes if you have any bills payable that that's an emergency shut in this case
[00:13:44] there's years of Runway and we're just scaling down so it's it's not an
[00:13:49] emergency situation it's just it's just a more efficiency I would say I I I would even say that this is responsible
[00:13:56] this is the right thing to do right um there's there's kind of diminishing
[00:14:01] returns on the amount that you can spend on things like events and uh promotion
[00:14:07] everything everything that is uh in a way nice to have like events that is
[00:14:14] $75,000 of cost um just just a two-day event um and editorial and and and
[00:14:24] Market most um more flashy marketing and
[00:14:29] things like that that that is not going to and and travel everywhere and things like that that is going to be cut
[00:14:37] um then I have my personal opinion about something I don't know if if you want
[00:14:43] me tell you my personal opinion this this is something I told the ETC
[00:14:49] Cooperative before leaving and and I and I and I think that it should be
[00:14:55] done and that is that the the history of of ethereum classic the maintenance this
[00:15:02] this core function of the maintenance of the protocol and the and the and the
[00:15:09] client um started with a group of developers who decided to to to keep
[00:15:16] maintaining the original ethereum and ethereum classic continues to be the original ethereum and and that team was
[00:15:23] later called Etc dev then came another team called Etc labs
[00:15:29] which which was a private company that they decided to fund development and and um and and they
[00:15:37] moved the client in a in a controversial move from the ethereum classic
[00:15:42] repository the ethereum classic organization on GitHub to their own corporate uh GitHub repository and
[00:15:50] organization no Etc labs and then and then they left and and and and ioh ioh
[00:15:56] came and they tried to do their own client and then when everybody when when ioh ihk left and Etc
[00:16:06] Labs left then the ETC Cooperative continued development maintenance of the
[00:16:11] protocol and development of the client but all this time it was moved from
[00:16:17] ethereum classic from the ethereum classic um uh
[00:16:22] organization to Etc labs and it's been there all this time and that's core gu
[00:16:29] and and cor gu is the client that everybody uses in the in the etherum classic uh
[00:16:34] ecosystem I think that as uh one one of the goals of the
[00:16:40] ETC Cooperative should be to return the client to the etherum classic
[00:16:46] organization um I know I know it's it's just um a kind of administrative
[00:16:52] housekeeping thing but in terms of meaning and um
[00:16:59] an image of ethereum classic to the world uh I think it's very important to
[00:17:04] do it um first is to redeem ethereum classic from that attack that historic
[00:17:10] attack that is doesn't exist anymore but but it's is to to to show uh the
[00:17:15] resilience of Etc and second because Bitcoin is in the Bitcoin repository and
[00:17:20] ethereum is in the ethereum repository and ripple is in the Ripple repository
[00:17:25] and Solana is in the Solana repository only Etc is in some XYZ repository it
[00:17:32] has to be an ethereum classic I think that's serious that shows seriousness and professionalism uh which is very
[00:17:38] important to project no so that that's my only thing that I that I left as a
[00:17:49] message yeah I would say I'd agree with that um I guess there's a couple of ways of doing it one would just be
[00:17:56] forking and then continuing in the ethereum classic repo or or repo and the
[00:18:02] other would be transferring the ownership from labs to the
[00:18:10] org and the latter would be preferable but I guess requires more uh
[00:18:17] coordination yeah well no I I think that the the the the core developers of the
[00:18:25] ETC Cooperative they proposed I think a clever uh way of doing it which
[00:18:31] was for now keep maintaining it at Etc at the ETC Labs
[00:18:37] repository and in the next hard Fork when the whole ecosystem has to migrate
[00:18:42] to the new one that hard for that hard Fork to do it with a client already in the in the
[00:18:50] ethereum classic repository so that everybody has to switch from one repository to the other um at once and I
[00:18:59] thought that was a good idea yeah that would most likely work and if the links
[00:19:06] on the website were updated that would be doable the only downside with the 4
[00:19:11] King approach is that the issues and the poor requests I guess
[00:19:17] will be lost um and remain on the old Labs or Reaper so I
[00:19:26] mean I I would say that the proposed um switch on next hard Fork
[00:19:35] is a good solution but not perfect but uh will be better than nothing better
[00:19:42] than the current situation yeah I think that the community could define whether this is
[00:19:49] important for us and I think I think that it really bothers me uh that the
[00:19:56] that the that the main client and um Flagship client of VC is in a private
[00:20:03] corporate xyc repository and not in the in the in the in the one that is the
[00:20:11] name of ethereum classic and where the ecip process is and where the website is and where the whole Community
[00:20:18] Works um so I think if if if the Community Values this
[00:20:23] change uh we can keep we can communicate it to the co cooperative and and see if
[00:20:28] they do it eventually in the next hard Fork do you know when the next hard Fork
[00:20:34] is uh estimated no when we it depends on what
[00:20:40] ethereum is going to do I I think that we are up to date with ethereum so I don't know when is the ethereum next
[00:20:47] hard Fork I've been focusing more on the market and um on the benefits of Etc
[00:20:53] rather than the the ethereum hard Fork so I don't know I know there's one but I don't know know when when it's going to
[00:21:00] be right um similar uh topic I guess is that in the
[00:21:08] that post on Etc Co-op uh with Staffing changes Bob mentioned that there are
[00:21:14] potential challenges with gu maintenance going forward and uh they're looking at maybe um the
[00:21:23] devs are looking at with fresh eyes on Bess Aragon and nethermind
[00:21:29] as uh alternatives for longterm maintenance due to the difficulties of
[00:21:34] maintaining gu when Upstream has removed the proof of work uh code pass yeah yeah
[00:21:42] that that is something to talk to the developers but the complexity of maintaining the the client increased
[00:21:49] because before you would just get from the Upstream for from go ethereum you
[00:21:54] would get the code and it included proof of work now now they they stripped it out so from now
[00:22:02] on um the core the core developers of ethereum classic have to receive from
[00:22:08] the Upstream something that does not have proof of work and they have to reintegrate it each time um so that
[00:22:16] that's an additional work or challenge uh in maintenance um so the two the two
[00:22:22] strategies what what um Bob meant there is okay we can continue maintaining an
[00:22:28] independent client cor gu with all of these uh challenges and the work that it
[00:22:34] requires Etc or we can go to an upstream
[00:22:39] client like hyperledger Basu or nether mind or go with there and ask them for
[00:22:48] us to integrate the rules of Etc there um and and the the rules of Etc live
[00:22:57] there inside um an upstream client instead of us maintaining the the independent client I
[00:23:05] think that Etc that that that that that that's being considered I think that the
[00:23:10] what's going to Prevail is to keep maintaining the the independent
[00:23:15] client but that's being analyzed uh or maybe the two in
[00:23:20] parallel just as a hedge right I I think that we have to just
[00:23:27] keep uh maintaining the core get client put it back in our repository for the
[00:23:33] community to gain full control not thec Cooperative the community to gain full control and
[00:23:39] access to the client and if for some reason in 10 years the ETC Cooperative disappears the community keeps keeps
[00:23:46] going no keep keeps M um that's what I think we have to do
[00:23:52] and if for some reason the ATC say that thec this is the year 2027 or the year
[00:23:57] 2028 and the ETC Cooperative say okay we have we have only $100 left in the bank sorry
[00:24:04] we we we have to leave at that point the ETC cooperate have to deliver the client
[00:24:11] working and stable and then leave and that's it uh as long as it is in the
[00:24:16] community repository there's no problem that's how blockchains work developers change all the time in
[00:24:24] fact Etc has had four developer teams already so this happens all the time you just have to leave the client um with
[00:24:32] with with the most updated version in a stable condition that people can run it and then somebody else is going to
[00:24:39] continue the work um right and
[00:24:44] generally uh even if there are no updates the the chain will still
[00:24:50] continue to be mined and it's unlikely there's some some critical issue that uh
[00:24:57] exactly is going to occur yeah for example yeah but always from a develop perspective
[00:25:05] when you talk to the developers they are going to they're not going to have that opinion their opinion
[00:25:11] is going to be that they worry that there's something wrong that there may be a bug and you discover it in two
[00:25:17] years and we didn't know and we thought that it was stable and then there's no
[00:25:22] one to fix it uh I think that's that's that's another
[00:25:29] Yos Yos it's a reasonable posture no
[00:25:36] yeah but it's also more likely that developers will jump in and if they
[00:25:41] notice something that can be fixed they'll be like oh let's let's patch this before it becomes an issue yeah
[00:25:49] yeah there's there there this is this is one thing that I that that I explained
[00:25:54] the to the board of the ETC Cooperative we don't have to think that the that Etc Cooperative is the savior of Etc right
[00:26:02] um and without us then Superman doesn't exist and the world is going to collapse no it uh it is going to continue uh we
[00:26:11] just have to do a good job delivering it we just have to do a good job maintaining the basic infrastructure as
[00:26:17] we are doing now we have we still have money there's no emergency and if for some
[00:26:23] reason uh the ETC Cooperative is going to cease then at that time just deliver
[00:26:29] a stable client uh in the ETC Cooperative
[00:26:34] repo and somebody else is going to take uh care of of the client in the
[00:26:41] future um that that's that's the mission to to deliver it to the community in a
[00:26:47] stable condition yep and I think that's a perfectly legit uh approach and anything
[00:26:53] that can extend the uh the lifespan of that delivering that is is probably a
[00:27:00] good thing and as we're seeing there's already other and there's constantly other
[00:27:06] teams uh stepping up and filling the void of of exactly whatever kind of
[00:27:12] thing that needs to be done uh that's very that's that's a very important
[00:27:17] thought because it's difficult to see currently
[00:27:23] the ETC Cooperative is filling a void and because the void is filled
[00:27:28] then there's no other client developers who want to come and and and and work
[00:27:34] why because the the void is filled when when in in marketplaces in Industries
[00:27:39] when somebody is already the leader for example in electric vehicles uh there there may be other
[00:27:46] competitors that become second third and fourth but once you you have a a group of companies filling the void there's no
[00:27:52] more investment in in trying to compete anymore it doesn't make sense to spend more money competing in that industry
[00:27:57] and the same thing happens in open source once you have a a good team of developers managing a system then why
[00:28:05] would other developers come when but if they leave then there's going to be a void then it makes sense for other
[00:28:11] developers to come and they will come and they will come because ethereum classic is incredibly
[00:28:17] valuable and the developers that actually work at Etc gain incredible
[00:28:22] valuable experience and they become very sought after uh because of their
[00:28:27] knowledge um so so this is this is this is to to to say
[00:28:36] that there there's no there's no emergency and that there's going to be someone who's going to fill the void if
[00:28:42] for some reason uh um development needs to migrate to a new
[00:28:48] team yeah and I'd say that void is not limited just to development but also the
[00:28:54] other things like marketing and education that you
[00:29:00] uh uh that that are being cut to some extent from Etc Co-op and there are other avenues that are doing this we've
[00:29:07] got the ETC radio stuff you've got the ambassador program which is coming up uh which I haven't looked into too much but
[00:29:14] seems to be promising yes for example I already
[00:29:21] created a video in my in my blog ather plan which is where I used to write and and create videos before
[00:29:29] working for the ETC cooperative and I am going to I I have a passion for ETC
[00:29:35] um um and I'm going to dedicate my time and everything to Etc so I'm going to
[00:29:41] continue writing uh in the on ether plan and continue contributing just like
[00:29:47] before so that's an example of how the void is filled by
[00:29:54] others that's great to hear and likewise uh uh I guess this year I've been a
[00:29:59] little hands off in terms of personal contributions I've always been
[00:30:04] volunteering but I think next year partially because of this downsizing of
[00:30:10] Etc Co-op I feel uh the void needs to be filled to some extent and I will try to
[00:30:15] step up more in terms of my contributions too yeah you you built the
[00:30:20] the ethereum class.org website that is amazing um and and that's an incredible
[00:30:27] product that's an excellent example of a of a purely voluntary um
[00:30:35] effort um yeah uh I see that uh brol LA's in the
[00:30:42] chat are you uh on the mic
[00:30:52] bro hello hey hi bro how are you yeah we
[00:30:58] can good how are you Donald very well thank
[00:31:04] you um nice to hear you again guys uh
[00:31:10] one quick question that I had so if Bob was saying that he may want
[00:31:19] to uh follow the path of another client or other clients uh what will happen
[00:31:26] with uh the the 6,000 nodes about made by
[00:31:34] ETMC because there are a lot of them and I believe that their main noes are
[00:31:41] basically running uh an interface a vanill interface for cor right
[00:31:51] MH gget is going to continue to exist it's going to continue being maintained
[00:31:56] what they're studying is to get an upstream client that that works for
[00:32:03] ethereum for example cor cor is always uh receives the the new rules for
[00:32:12] the new hard forks from go ethereum that's one of the clients that exist in
[00:32:18] ethereum there's another client called nethermind um and then there's others
[00:32:25] like hyper Ledger Basu and um is B still supported by the Linux
[00:32:35] Foundation yes that one hyperledger uh the Basu and then there's
[00:32:41] another one called arigon I think and so and there's more so the idea is to go to
[00:32:49] one of those and integrate Etc to ask for permission and to have ask access
[00:32:55] and and to collaborate with with the team and to integrate Etc into that node so that node it it
[00:33:03] can it can run either etherium or Etc uh as an option um just to have it
[00:33:10] as a backup in case cor get disappears and people have to migrate to that one it's it's only a backup but core gu is
[00:33:17] going to continue to be maintained therefore atmc is going to continue to have core gu as their client yes but
[00:33:24] earlier you are saying about um coret getting um more uh more of an issue when
[00:33:33] it comes to maintenance because well proof of work is no longer
[00:33:39] there in the client that has been built
[00:33:45] so would would the board uh think about maintaining the client and hiring more
[00:33:52] people or they would just look in another Direction because this could be
[00:33:59] an important topic
[00:34:04] right the the decision now is that um the ETC Cooperative with the two core
[00:34:11] developers they are going to maintain poor gu even if proof of work
[00:34:18] was taken out from go ethereum um I see yeah um at least for
[00:34:24] the next hard Fork if for some reason it becomes imposs possible to maintain um I I don't
[00:34:31] know I don't know what what what they're going to do but there's always going to be a version that is that is usable for
[00:34:39] ethereum classic but at least for the next hard Fork we have I mean DTC Cooperative is
[00:34:46] going to be here for more than two years so I think uh the next hard fork for GU is going to
[00:34:52] have is going to do the hard fork and have proof of work and everything is going to be integrated
[00:34:59] it and another thing related to to the board will they decide the the next uh
[00:35:09] executive director or is that is that something they plan next
[00:35:15] year or right away or do they have any information about who
[00:35:23] lead uh the ETC C no I I am not in
[00:35:29] contact with the board lately other than the ideas that I gave them I I'm not in contact with them
[00:35:35] and I don't know what they're doing the only thing that I know is that the team is going to be reduced uh by January 1st
[00:35:44] and the spending is going to be reduced from 100,000 to
[00:35:49] 74,000 and the ETC Cooperative is going to stay um with that burn rate from then on
[00:35:58] that that's the information that I have up to now uh and
[00:36:03] then I think they're going to decide the final structure of the ETC Co
[00:36:09] Cooperative by by January 31st but I do not know what what is the
[00:36:17] plan okay thank you it's it's something that the board ising I don't know it's something that they they will
[00:36:24] decide but again what I said before the board the board has very clear that the base protocol the client and
[00:36:31] infrastructure are the things that they have to maintain and they and the ET C has money so one way or or another that
[00:36:40] those are the priorities um maybe you also know has
[00:36:46] the board uh express any let's say uh improvements that they
[00:36:55] would like for the protocol because um so far
[00:37:02] we ITC basically um followed
[00:37:08] ether till uh now and even the last part for mistake was uh uh was after ether uh
[00:37:19] will they continue on this path or would they like for maybe a new vision
[00:37:26] maybe uh open grants for for E proposals or stuff like
[00:37:34] that open grants for what easy
[00:37:39] proposals e easy proposals I didn't understand what kind
[00:37:45] of proposal EC ECI for the itan classic Improvement
[00:37:52] proposal ecip proposals yeah um
[00:37:58] the I know that the plan of the ETC Cooperative is to stay keep the protocol
[00:38:05] and the client on par with the ethereum virtual machine standard that means whatever hard Fork ethereum does that
[00:38:14] everybody else has to copy we're going to copy there's there's no I don't think that there's any plan
[00:38:20] to to to do things outside of the central core innovation path of of
[00:38:32] ethereum I would assume that uh would ensuring that it matches the uh the
[00:38:39] principles of Etc in that there yeah if there were changes that broke old
[00:38:45] contracts for example then um yes we would might consider skipping that one
[00:38:52] yeah for for example uh Etc is not going to implement
[00:38:57] proof of stake and it's going to keep maintaining proof of work that's that's the an example of how ITC is going to
[00:39:05] keep being Etc know immutable truly decentralized Etc uh but if there's a
[00:39:11] new OP code and that it's necessary that is going to be integrated um and then if if uh I I
[00:39:19] think that the e559 uh the core developers were
[00:39:24] studying how to integrate it in a a way that um developers can use it but at the
[00:39:32] same time that does not burn uh funds so that it doesn't change the monetary policy things like that
[00:39:39] those are adaptations of Innovations in ethereum that can be adapted to Etc without
[00:39:46] changing the principles of ET of
[00:39:55] Etc oh um so on that on that topic of uh principles of Etc I wanted to
[00:40:03] mention some interesting insights I got from watching the the videos of Devcon 7
[00:40:09] which occurred uh last month I believe did any of you watch any of those uh
[00:40:17] conference events I didn't watch it okay um you may be interested to
[00:40:24] learn that one of the major themes this year was was make ethereum Cipher Punk
[00:40:30] again and during the intro of the the event there was a little animation that
[00:40:36] you might want to look at um that included things like ethereum is
[00:40:41] immutable ethereum is Unstoppable blah blah blah and um the idea is that
[00:40:49] etherum that there are some people within the main ethereum project that are calling out the centralization risk
[00:40:56] and the takeover of uh profit seeking entities I guess that are subverting the
[00:41:04] principles of AUM which um I believe are upheld by etherum
[00:41:11] classic much better than mainnet so I see it as maybe a potential opportunity
[00:41:16] for ethereum classic to kind of pitch itself in terms of being the original
[00:41:24] and um uh continuing to Main maintain those original Cipher Punk ideals um and
[00:41:31] having them as primary as opposed to ethereum main net which is now realizing
[00:41:38] that those things should have been more important to begin with yeah I think I think that the ethereum
[00:41:45] classic Community can how it should be can communicate to
[00:41:52] the ETC Cooperative what is desirable uh for future change changes
[00:41:58] for example we we've spoke we spoke in the past about
[00:42:03] um er er setting setting or fixing the
[00:42:10] block size to 8 million gas potentially or 12 million gas so that the block has
[00:42:15] a fixed size um and miners cannot change it anymore that would be a different a
[00:42:22] different approach than ethereum ether right than the was before no where the
[00:42:28] miners could change the block size and raise it to 30 million gas and things like
[00:42:33] that um and I and I think that the the the ET Community should be the main
[00:42:42] influence um for future for future changes um I think for example there's a
[00:42:50] there's a huge change that I wrote about called eof in ethereum that is a a big
[00:42:57] modification of the evm that if ethereum doesn't do doesn't do it I think that
[00:43:03] the community should pressure or should implement it in in
[00:43:08] ETC um because they're they're very important changes and of
[00:43:14] course um that's because I I um I I really see the independence of Etc as
[00:43:21] very important but the developers and Bob told me well the thing is that it's going to become not compatible with
[00:43:27] ethereum temporarily until ethereum implements eof um so and that's true so if if e the
[00:43:35] takes two more years to implement eof Etc is not going to be compatible with with etherum for those two years and
[00:43:42] then the other risk is that ethereum by the time ethereum implements eof they
[00:43:48] may Implement um a different version of eof and in that case we're going to have
[00:43:54] to do another hard fork and and and realign with with with
[00:43:59] ethereum but well know it's just an example of things that I think the the community
[00:44:06] should uh voice and and and mark the the future
[00:44:11] direction of of um of innovation and and development of
[00:44:18] Etc always with the principles of M of the cipher Punk principles of of
[00:44:24] immutability and Trust minimization that ethereum has my observation what
[00:44:32] occurs to me that ethereum has a like a a a subculture or a
[00:44:37] subgroup that is trying to bring back the cipher Punk principles uh to
[00:44:45] ethereum is very important because there is a there's a growing
[00:44:50] there is a growing concern in the ethereum community that ethereum has become centralized
[00:44:57] I mean very delayed no because we know that the day that they migrated to proof
[00:45:03] of stake uh ethereum died it's dead uh why because it's a centralized
[00:45:09] Fiat system they just don't know it and people don't know it the great majority
[00:45:15] of the public for buying ethereum and they doing the ETFs and they're building layer 2 systems and all that on ethereum
[00:45:21] and wallets and and thinking and doing nfts and all that they don't know that
[00:45:26] ethereum is dead because they don't know anything about this technology 99% of the people of the world don't know
[00:45:33] anything of how this technology works and the principles uh um and all that
[00:45:38] the only way they're going to learn is when they confiscate their funds in ethereum and they Fork their app and
[00:45:44] they can't use it anymore and they get censored and then they're going to say wait a minute this this was not the
[00:45:50] promise so this is why uh there there's this concern because they're realizing
[00:45:57] that ethereum is is really centralized and I'm very glad that there's people doing that uh and and that this is the
[00:46:05] basis of why I think that at some point it's going to be widely known that ethereum is dead and that they have been
[00:46:12] working all these years in a dead system dead meaning it's centralized now right and I think that ethereum classic is
[00:46:20] going to replace ethereum everybody's going to migrate to Etc uh because it's the only other
[00:46:25] viable system live that is there to immediately migrate to I believe so as
[00:46:32] well yeah I um I think that it may even be the case that uh a lot of ethereum
[00:46:40] people that joined the ethereum community after the hard Fork after etherum Classic was
[00:46:48] really in the in the spotlight they probably don't even know what a the classic is or why it exists and it may
[00:46:56] be uh a good strategy to actually kind of
[00:47:03] align ethereum classic as not antagonistic to ethereum but as a kind
[00:47:10] of um almost an ally if you like at least
[00:47:17] to the those Cipher punk people like we're actually on the same side it's
[00:47:22] just that we kind of disagree about the the end the means to achieving that end
[00:47:28] and we can we can persuade you amicably yeah if there's a they tell me
[00:47:36] that to the death def conon what was it Devcon 7 yeah they said it it was they
[00:47:42] told me there it was the biggest one there were 12,000 people uh and and there's like a
[00:47:48] subculture in ethereum that wants to go back to The Cypher Punk um principles
[00:47:55] yes we we can tell them that we are allies of that our that our strategy is
[00:48:02] to use ethereum classic that's the that's the trueu their strategy is to try to change ethereum which is a
[00:48:10] Monumental task it's something that it's too costly it's too big um to to they're
[00:48:18] going against people with uh vested interests that don't want to allow it to
[00:48:23] be Cypher exactly
[00:48:28] so so yeah we can we can go to those people we can somehow make noise and and
[00:48:35] and invite them to see this the there there is the there is a a real and true
[00:48:43] objective uh thing that that happens is that the all the liquidity and the network effects are with ethereum not
[00:48:50] with Etc um so it's very difficult and very
[00:48:55] costly to to to to Market Etc to people
[00:49:00] and expect that it's going to gain market share and become um replace ethereum just by
[00:49:08] marketing I think um I mean it would it would cost billions of dollarss to explain to the world this and to
[00:49:16] actually accomplish the switch the to switch the world from ethereum to Etc so
[00:49:23] I think it it has to happen organically by ethereum Dying by
[00:49:30] itself I think that's that's that's true for the majority of people that are not
[00:49:36] really interested in the tech or the philosophy and they will basically just
[00:49:41] follow whichever is alive and working but I think there is there is a a small
[00:49:49] group of genuine Believers of Cipher Punk philosophy that exist within ET ethereum
[00:49:56] and ET that cannot really be persuaded by traditional marketing anyway like
[00:50:01] they're not going to see an advertisement but they do care about the principle and I think
[00:50:09] um kind of I I'm still working on this idea but
[00:50:15] maybe the The Branding or the the the
[00:50:20] narrative could be updated to some extent to to to try and capture those those guys um hearts and
[00:50:29] Minds yeah there there could be a um that that but that's a good me
[00:50:36] segment that you caught and that you observed and and it's a segment that we could work on
[00:50:43] specifically in my case for because because now as of December 31st I'm
[00:50:49] going to be out of a job and I'm not going to have a job I was thinking of
[00:50:55] getting a a sponsor a donor for ethereum classic that would donate to excuse me
[00:51:02] for ether plan my my my brand that works
[00:51:07] on ethereum classic um to get a donation and because what I do is content and
[00:51:12] marketing and and um explaining these things that that's my mission in in my
[00:51:18] life is one of the missions in my life is to explain to the world why ethereum classic has to replace ethereum and
[00:51:24] become the largest blockchain in the world together with Bitcoin um and what I would what I
[00:51:31] wanted to do is get all the biggest blockchain meetup groups in in
[00:51:39] Vancouver Seattle San Francisco Los Angeles New York Chicago London
[00:51:47] Berlin Shanghai Hong Kong Etc and for a year go to call them invite tell them
[00:51:55] that we donate Pizza and and and the beers and everything and and that we can
[00:52:00] go and chat for an hour to to to their to their group no to all the ethereum
[00:52:07] blockchain groups this is this is a campaign that I was going to do in 2019 for ETC Dev but um but was cancelled
[00:52:15] because Etc Dev was replaced by Etc Labs um so this is this is to go in in
[00:52:24] these meetups and explain all the things that I always always explain Etc is the true one it's truly decentralized e
[00:52:31] ethereum is dead e Etc is going to replace it why because these are and I
[00:52:36] explain my nine reasons and usually when I explain these things in person people
[00:52:41] say yes I'm sold and they and sometimes they even buy immediately uh they in front of me they
[00:52:48] buy Etc because they are so convinced of the truth right um because the truth is the
[00:52:54] truth so I wanted to this this tour and and now that you say this I could I
[00:53:00] could focus my tour in the in that community in that sub subculture within
[00:53:07] ethereum yeah and I think the the meetup groups are much more likely they have a higher ratio of True Believers compared
[00:53:13] to just um you know uh in it for the the money
[00:53:20] people I believe yeah and I I I I genuinely think
[00:53:25] that sorry I think that yeah when the chain doesn't have massive VC funds then
[00:53:33] the type of idea that you just mentioned like going to meetups and it's almost like Guerilla Warfare where you have to
[00:53:39] think outside the box for for marketing and targeting specific message and uh
[00:53:46] persuasion through ideology as opposed to just spending money on ads is
[00:53:52] definitely I think the the only way we can uh we can spread the word yes I
[00:53:59] agree so I hope to find a a donor a sponsor uh
[00:54:05] soon do you have any Targets in terms of raising and maybe you could do like a a
[00:54:12] fund raise like a an like a a oneman Ico
[00:54:17] or something like that yeah I I'm think I'm thinking of
[00:54:24] one one is to do um uh uh a fundraise that starts on I'll
[00:54:30] say on January 1st and ends on January 30 and communicated to the community and
[00:54:35] that the community contributes but usually that that contribute when when I've done that in the past I received
[00:54:42] like $1,000 or ,500 but to do a world
[00:54:47] tour you need $150,000 we need we need a big donor big
[00:54:54] big donors I see I I think I'm I think the cost
[00:55:01] what my my cost that I calculated in in 2019 was um $200,000 to do the whole
[00:55:07] tour for a year um and um because this requires me to be
[00:55:16] dedicated fulltime to to this effort uh it's not part-time or something like
[00:55:21] that um and and it required the whole ticket the airline ticket the hotel the
[00:55:26] travel and donating the food and the drinks to each Meetup um and so I guess now with
[00:55:35] inflation it must be around $250,000 I would have to do the
[00:55:40] numbers interesting yeah I think the uh it's a great idea uh it's outside the
[00:55:47] the normal approach and I think uh if anyone's able to promote it it's you
[00:55:55] yeah yeah because a lot of people are talking about Etc no it main for example um and now
[00:56:04] the ATC Cooperative without me and um but they don't know they they they
[00:56:11] they don't see it the same way they they they um I mean I I see that bitmain for
[00:56:17] example they repeat slogans and things like that like you say Ad like common advertising but that that is not
[00:56:24] effective I I when when I explain Etc um people really understand the full
[00:56:32] logic of the right of the situation um
[00:56:39] and the great majority didn't even know the proof of stake was centralized and and they just see when of the people at
[00:56:45] the theorum they say this is decentralized this is immutable um then this is censorship
[00:56:52] resistant and uh it's going to be private and that there's a uh a road map
[00:56:57] and the road map is going to be better and better and better and they just believe that why because they don't know
[00:57:02] they don't have any notion of these things and they don't know the principles and they don't know what
[00:57:09] technologies actually fit the principles uh but when I explain these things and because I explain it in a
[00:57:16] layman's terms people immediately understand the
[00:57:21] difference and they become Etc here in Oklahoma for example I have friends that are total Etc
[00:57:27] Buffs it's funny it's funny because we're here in in the in the rural areas
[00:57:32] of Oklahoma and we I have people that are buying Etc they're mining Etc uh it's like a little island of Etc
[00:57:40] here because they because they're hear me all the time we we we do a barbecue and I talk to them about what's going on
[00:57:46] and things like that and and and they just see the truth that's cool yeah I think uh you
[00:57:52] should definitely do that and uh hopefully someone hears this and uh Tres
[00:57:58] to make it happen yeah yeah I'm going to see I'm going to
[00:58:04] see if I can get the donation cool well we are coming up to
[00:58:10] an hour which is usually about the time we spend on these calls and uh it's nice
[00:58:16] to hear everyone uh everyone's voice for the first time in a while and uh glad
[00:58:22] we're able to catch up at the end of this year hopefully we can and get on a bit more of a regular schedule in
[00:58:30] 2025 as the uh the Carp Is reducing its uh output we can kind of fill the void
[00:58:37] there and try and uh brainstorm come with ideas of of how to um to make the
[00:58:43] best of 2025 so yeah we'll see you all next year
[00:58:48] thanks everyone for coming to this chat and uh yeah see you next time take care
[00:58:54] bye-bye thank you very very much
