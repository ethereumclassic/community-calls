## Call 040 — Transcript

[00:00:34] Also, we're streaming now then.
[00:00:39] Uh,
[00:00:42] sure. Hello everyone. Thanks for taking
[00:00:45] the time to join today. This is This
[00:00:47] call is meant to be
[00:00:51] inable. Was that the start
[00:00:58] noise? Anyway, this call is meant to be
[00:01:00] informal. It's We haven't had one of
[00:01:03] these in a while. It's a chance to catch
[00:01:04] up, talk about where etc stands, talk
[00:01:07] about the ideas we've been thinking
[00:01:09] about or we've been kicking around in
[00:01:11] the channels and in email threads. So
[00:01:14] this is kind of bring everyone together
[00:01:15] so we can
[00:01:17] discuss big picture is etc still here to
[00:01:20] stay if we want it to not just survive
[00:01:23] and be a coin
[00:01:25] that's kind of moving sideways for the
[00:01:28] last couple years and we keep coming to
[00:01:31] the chat rooms and just so we
[00:01:33] can troll each other. I mean, it's if
[00:01:38] it's going to survive, it's going to be
[00:01:39] because people that like this that show
[00:01:41] up to meetings, stay engaged, help shape
[00:01:43] the future. So, these
[00:01:45] are people in this call are the ones
[00:01:47] that uh I guess we need to talk to. So,
[00:01:50] I mean,
[00:01:51] there's big things that we need to talk
[00:01:53] about as a group, as Ethereum Classic,
[00:01:56] like core infrastructure, how we want to
[00:01:58] manage GT or what long-term view is on
[00:02:01] that if we want to keep chasing
[00:02:05] the latest updates of Ethereum or
[00:02:07] whether it's
[00:02:09] um we do other engineering on our own or
[00:02:13] how we decide on which forks happen.
[00:02:16] It's uh there's not a clear path right
[00:02:18] now or clear clear process on that. So
[00:02:21] coming together around that, how we make
[00:02:22] those decisions, funding and grants, how
[00:02:24] we engage with uh people who are wanting
[00:02:27] to build on the network, how we can have
[00:02:29] sustainable funding for all the things
[00:02:32] that aren't the sexy parts of
[00:02:34] cryptocurrency like running block
[00:02:35] explorers or
[00:02:38] uh keeping communication channels open,
[00:02:43] uh running test nets, things like that.
[00:02:49] um Ethereum Classic I guess in general
[00:02:52] as a cryptocurrency how we want to talk
[00:02:53] about it uh as a group still is the
[00:02:59] world shifted today from where it was
[00:03:02] even a year ago on
[00:03:05] uh standards around cryptocurrency.
[00:03:07] we're getting a lot more uh legal
[00:03:10] clarity around what rules will be in
[00:03:12] place around crypto and things involved
[00:03:16] in it. So defining what Ethereum Classic
[00:03:20] means in a world where there's thousands
[00:03:23] of L2s now there's uh tons of
[00:03:26] alternatives and block space is mostly
[00:03:30] unlimited. How do we get people to
[00:03:32] realize the real value of etc? The
[00:03:35] philosophical thing that keeps us all
[00:03:37] tethered to come to these chat
[00:03:41] rooms
[00:03:42] and the community. There's only what
[00:03:45] seven of us here of a top 20
[00:03:52] cryptocurrency. That's I mean the
[00:03:54] community is probably the most important
[00:03:55] for this whole thing to work. We need to
[00:03:58] bring people in, the people that are
[00:04:00] here, engaged with them. We got to
[00:04:03] figure out how to get everyone doing
[00:04:04] something productive.
[00:04:07] Uh I mean, you're if you're here today,
[00:04:09] you're already part of the story of
[00:04:11] what's current with etc., what's the
[00:04:14] latest voice? What's the who's driving
[00:04:17] the changes in it? This it's this group.
[00:04:19] This is the people who have come
[00:04:20] together. We want more builders. We want
[00:04:22] more node runners. We want more people
[00:04:24] testing and translating and spreading
[00:04:25] word. But
[00:04:28] there's there's no central company or no
[00:04:30] foundation that's going to be able to
[00:04:32] step in and run everything and just give
[00:04:36] Athereum Classic everything it needs.
[00:04:38] It's ours. It's so what we do next
[00:04:41] depends on all of us here in this call.
[00:04:43] So
[00:04:45] uh thank you for coming everyone. Uh and
[00:04:49] yeah, let's
[00:04:51] uh let's start the conversation I guess.
[00:04:58] Um, I don't have a a plan of how to
[00:05:03] tackle each of these or or how to
[00:05:04] discuss them. Uh, so feel free to come
[00:05:06] up to you, chime in. Um, I
[00:05:09] guess if no one else has any topics they
[00:05:12] want to discuss, we can just run through
[00:05:14] the ones I just hit.
[00:05:20] Yeah, I think if you want to maybe Cody
[00:05:22] talk about uh what we need on core uh
[00:05:26] core GU moving forward. Um I think
[00:05:29] that's probably a good start. Uh just in
[00:05:32] the sense that it's such critical
[00:05:34] software. Um
[00:05:37] generally the public doesn't really know
[00:05:40] where that stands after recent
[00:05:42] announcements of funding and things like
[00:05:44] that. Um, in fact, we don't even know
[00:05:46] who's working on it. We don't know if
[00:05:48] there's anyone staffed to work on it,
[00:05:50] uh, my understanding is that uh, the two
[00:05:54] developers that actually were,
[00:05:57] uh, able to work on it, uh, have left
[00:06:00] ETC co-op. So, um, and then I know that
[00:06:04] there's another developer there, Diego,
[00:06:06] but my understanding was that Diego was
[00:06:09] a Bezu developer. So, I don't know what
[00:06:11] he's been doing since uh Bezo has been
[00:06:13] dep deprecated for Ethereum Classic for
[00:06:17] I mean I I thought it was like 2023. Um
[00:06:20] I I forget the date, but um but if you
[00:06:23] could just fill us in maybe in what's
[00:06:25] going on with that. Definitely the last
[00:06:28] call we had was a community call on this
[00:06:30] stream and it was
[00:06:31] essentially uh etc co-op uh stating that
[00:06:35] they were running out of money. So, um,
[00:06:38] that's kind of where the conversation
[00:06:39] has left in this series of
[00:06:42] calls. So, I hope that's helpful.
[00:06:47] That's helpful.
[00:06:49] Uh, yeah. And right now, Diego's the uh
[00:06:54] core developer that's still with the
[00:06:56] co-op. So, he's still here. He's
[00:06:59] still doing patches as they come in from
[00:07:01] upstream.
[00:07:03] Uh, Basu still connects to Ethereum
[00:07:07] Classic. Uh, it's just not the preferred
[00:07:09] client. So, it it does exist. It it
[00:07:13] works. It's there. Uh, and Diego's work
[00:07:16] there is probably one of the things that
[00:07:18] will help us.
[00:07:20] Um
[00:07:22] cuz while we were doing whatever we were
[00:07:26] doing in ETC land, the rest of Ethereum
[00:07:28] moved on from the monolithic client
[00:07:32] standpoint of they have one node that
[00:07:34] does everything. They've moved to a
[00:07:36] modular architecture. Around the time of
[00:07:38] the merge, they split out all the
[00:07:40] consensus logic from the execution
[00:07:43] clients. So, GE got its uh or GE can run
[00:07:48] with any of the consensus clients. It's
[00:07:50] a separate node. Bas can run with any of
[00:07:52] the consensus clients because the
[00:07:54] execution is separate from consensus.
[00:07:56] But with ETC, we're still have a
[00:08:00] everything's all in one box. Our
[00:08:01] multiget has our mining, it has uh the
[00:08:05] execution, everything's all packaged in
[00:08:07] one. So we're always kind of tied to
[00:08:10] whatever changes are coming through from
[00:08:12] upstream on
[00:08:14] it. I mean I guess longterm the ideal
[00:08:18] would be to have something similar to
[00:08:20] the proof ofstake validator nodes for
[00:08:23] proof of work have a separate uh
[00:08:26] consensus node that manages
[00:08:29] etc's custom logic that isn't from
[00:08:32] upstream. So our handling of the bomb,
[00:08:34] handling how we do difficulty
[00:08:36] adjustment, uh the happening or piffning
[00:08:40] onchain, all of that would be in a
[00:08:41] consensus node and then all the changes
[00:08:44] from upstream Ethereum to the EVM would
[00:08:47] just be directs to whatever execution
[00:08:50] clients running. So we could use this
[00:08:52] consensus client with any execution
[00:08:54] client. It wouldn't just be tied to G or
[00:08:56] BU. It would be um any of them would be
[00:08:59] available to us.
[00:09:01] Hey, can I just jump in here? Hi guys.
[00:09:03] Um, I just want to let everyone know
[00:09:05] that Diego uh since the other devs
[00:09:08] joined at the beginning of 2023, he's
[00:09:10] been working with them uh with Corg. So,
[00:09:14] he has he may not have as much
[00:09:16] experience as they had, but he is able
[00:09:19] to do what's necessary with Corg as
[00:09:22] well. So don't be concerned that he's
[00:09:24] just been there on his own doing stuff
[00:09:26] with Beu and doesn't have the ability um
[00:09:29] to do what's necessary now because he
[00:09:31] does. So he's had, you know, two years
[00:09:33] of experience working with those guys.
[00:09:35] They were working as um a really tight
[00:09:37] team. So uh he was able to pick up all
[00:09:40] that knowledge over the last couple
[00:09:41] years.
[00:09:43] Cool. That's very helpful. Thanks.
[00:09:49] Um, yeah. And so that's uh that's I
[00:09:52] guess the where we're at on development.
[00:09:54] I mean,
[00:09:58] so to so to touch on what you were just
[00:10:00] talking about, Cody, um do uh is Diego
[00:10:04] competent to do that development work?
[00:10:07] Is that what he's tasked with doing now
[00:10:09] or um is that something that we will
[00:10:13] need to staff for? And you know, and it
[00:10:18] sounds like a pretty deep plan to split
[00:10:20] those apart. Um, has another team
[00:10:22] already done this for proof of work? Uh,
[00:10:25] you mentioned that it's it's happened
[00:10:27] for proof of stake, but has that been
[00:10:29] done by any different network that uses
[00:10:32] Gath? Uh, so so we maybe have some
[00:10:35] audits or source source code to work
[00:10:37] with? Um, do you know any of that stuff
[00:10:39] by chance or is it still too early?
[00:11:05] if someone's talking. I can't hear
[00:11:06] anyone talking. This is some of the old
[00:11:08] issues we had with Discord. So, I'm
[00:11:10] going to re I can't hear either. So,
[00:11:17] Cody, try to uh try to rejoin. This has
[00:11:20] happened in the past where this is why
[00:11:22] we were kind of moving to Twitter spaces
[00:11:24] for these type of
[00:11:29] things. Yeah. Maybe go on your I have to
[00:11:32] go on my phone. Maybe go on your phone
[00:11:34] if you're on your laptop.
[00:12:21] Yeah, we can hear you now.
[00:12:24] I guess I dropped out. Sorry. Where did
[00:12:26] Where did I leave off at? You dropped
[00:12:29] out before you started talking. Like
[00:12:30] right as I was finishing talking. Oh
[00:12:33] man, that's crazy. So y'all have just
[00:12:36] been listening to silence for the last
[00:12:38] Okay,
[00:12:41] honey. Uh
[00:12:44] yeah. So I
[00:12:47] guess was Allison audible.
[00:12:51] Yeah. Allison and I were talking. Um but
[00:12:54] but I think Okay, cool.
[00:12:58] Yeah. So
[00:13:00] uh what I had said I guess out of the
[00:13:03] whole thing. Sorry.
[00:13:06] We could hear you up until uh I was
[00:13:08] asking you. I was doing a follow-up and
[00:13:10] I had just asked you uh if you had done
[00:13:13] the research on it like do we need to
[00:13:14] staff up for it? Any of those things?
[00:13:17] Did you hear that part? No, I didn't
[00:13:19] hear that part. I think got dropped.
[00:13:22] Okay. So, I had we heard you uh kind of
[00:13:25] explain the the uh core guest stuff and
[00:13:27] splitting the proof of work out and
[00:13:29] everything. Um is Diego capable of doing
[00:13:32] that? Uh
[00:13:34] is do we need to find staff for that?
[00:13:38] Um, is there already source code? Has
[00:13:40] another team already built the uh split
[00:13:43] out the core gath for proof of work?
[00:13:47] Um, or is it just too early in the
[00:13:49] research? What kind of what's what's the
[00:13:52] situation with everything you just
[00:13:53] talked about?
[00:13:55] I would say probably too early in the
[00:13:57] research right now. Uh, I don't think we
[00:14:01] would do this on his own. I mean, he'd
[00:14:04] be a great candidate for coordinating
[00:14:06] teams. Whenever Ethereum mainet did
[00:14:08] this, it took a effort of several teams
[00:14:12] building this out uh over months to get
[00:14:16] it put together. It's u it's not a small
[00:14:18] effort, I guess, is the I don't want to
[00:14:22] trivialize it and say we can
[00:14:24] just copy and paste some code. This
[00:14:26] would be actual engineering work that
[00:14:27] would have to be get done. We'd have to
[00:14:29] define how the protocol works together.
[00:14:32] make sure we're matching up with the API
[00:14:35] spec that they have for the consensus
[00:14:37] nodes on mainet for
[00:14:41] um for their proof of state. So, we'd
[00:14:44] have to use the same interface. We'd
[00:14:45] have to
[00:14:48] um figure
[00:14:51] out I'm sure there's a ton of trip wires
[00:14:53] along the way. So the short answer is
[00:14:56] it's it's a decision we have to make as
[00:14:58] a community that we have to commit to
[00:15:01] and figure out the work that needs to be
[00:15:03] done and start going down that path.
[00:15:05] It's not a a quick way
[00:15:07] or something we can just throw over the
[00:15:10] fence
[00:15:12] and hope that one or two developers pick
[00:15:14] it up and run with it.
[00:15:18] Yeah. And so from my understanding, it
[00:15:20] sounds like this is going to be a
[00:15:21] necessity as we continue to maintain uh
[00:15:24] protocol parody with the EVM standard,
[00:15:26] right? Um as it's just going to keep
[00:15:29] getting worse if we don't make this this
[00:15:31] change to the client.
[00:15:35] Yeah, it's we're on a limited timeline
[00:15:38] with how long we can use the current
[00:15:40] Ethereum clients. They've all moved to
[00:15:43] proof of stake or mainet's proof of
[00:15:45] stake now. So anyone who's building a
[00:15:47] client for Ethereum is just building an
[00:15:49] execution client or they're just
[00:15:50] building a consensus client. It's
[00:15:53] there's G itself has started to chop all
[00:15:56] the code out for proof of work. Uh Basu
[00:15:59] did the same. So
[00:16:02] it's if we don't commit to figuring how
[00:16:06] to make this work, then we're going to
[00:16:08] have to fully maintain our own code in
[00:16:12] the future going forward, which is an
[00:16:15] option. Uh just keep the lights on, keep
[00:16:17] doing what we're doing, evaluate forks
[00:16:19] as they come, and hope there's no
[00:16:21] breaking
[00:16:22] changes.
[00:16:24] Um but
[00:16:26] that's I guess that's what we kind of
[00:16:29] need to decide as a group. Is this
[00:16:31] something worth engaging on or is this
[00:16:35] are there other things that are a higher
[00:16:37] priority right now in the overall
[00:16:40] development pipeline?
[00:16:44] And is uh GU the desired client to
[00:16:48] continue with or is this a moment where
[00:16:52] um there might be another client out
[00:16:54] there that you know has more features or
[00:16:57] is more performative
[00:16:59] uh that it would make sense to maybe
[00:17:02] uh perform this work on instead of the
[00:17:06] guest stack? How do what what's your
[00:17:08] view on that? Or is guest still
[00:17:10] the upstream of choice?
[00:17:15] It would be more of a choice of which uh
[00:17:18] execution client you want to use. Right
[00:17:20] now we're tied together because that's
[00:17:21] where everything
[00:17:30] is. All right. Uh does anyone else have
[00:17:33] any questions about this? Anyone Anyone
[00:17:36] else in the chat?
[00:17:42] Um does does the
[00:17:44] potential beforeation of the node into
[00:17:49] an execution client and and into a
[00:17:52] consensus
[00:17:53] client mean that there's going to be a
[00:17:57] layer 1 and layer two within the network
[00:18:00] or some analogy of that.
[00:18:19] For example, where will there be nodes
[00:18:22] and miners running only the consensus
[00:18:25] client and other people in the world
[00:18:28] running only the execution client and
[00:18:31] they have to connect over the internet
[00:18:34] to to integrate information and things
[00:18:36] like that?
[00:18:48] Cody, I think. Yeah.
[00:18:51] Yeah. Cody, I don't think we can hear
[00:18:53] you again.
[00:19:01] Dang. Here, I think something I can do.
[00:19:03] We can we can fire up uh Twitter spaces
[00:19:06] real quick and probably share a link and
[00:19:07] get a recording going there and then LOL
[00:19:10] can can participate as well. I think
[00:19:13] that's something maybe. Yeah, I think
[00:19:14] so. This obviously is not working.
[00:19:48] Were you able to hear the freeird? Did
[00:19:50] that answer your question? We're not
[00:19:52] hearing you. Um I think I think Freeird
[00:19:55] said he's going to just start a Twitter
[00:19:56] spaces and then also LOL can take part
[00:19:59] because this is not working well.
[00:20:18] Okay. So, we go to general and we we we
[00:20:21] we wait for the link there.
[00:20:30] Yeah, sounds
[00:20:33] good. Pretty good.
