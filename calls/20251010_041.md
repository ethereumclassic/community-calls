## Call 041 — Transcript

[00:00:00] I will kick off the call with a bit of a a preamble and maybe we'll get some
[00:00:06] joiners as I'm reading this. So, I'll just get this out the way. Uh but usually I start with hello and welcome
[00:00:12] to Ethereum Classic community call. Today is the 10th of October 2025. This call is today on Zoom instead of
[00:00:19] Discord in order to cater for all regions. So, sorry for the last minute change and thanks for accommodating. The
[00:00:26] call is being recorded and will be published to YouTube. This is a special call to discuss the
[00:00:32] topic of how Ethereum Classic might integrate EIP1559.
[00:00:37] The call was spurred by ongoing discussion within the ETC community and in particular by a recent post on GitHub
[00:00:43] by Diego, a core developer contributing to the Ethereum classic node clients.
[00:00:48] Diego's full post in is in discussion 541 and is recommended reading. But as a
[00:00:55] very brief summary, Ethereum mainet has lainks implemented EIP1559
[00:01:00] which is a modified transaction fee system that improves user experience when pricing transaction during hightra
[00:01:07] periods to maintain to maintain compatibility with Ethereum up codes and future smart contract patterns. It may
[00:01:14] be worth considering adopting this EIP with Ethereum Classic. I wanted this call to be a relatively free form
[00:01:20] discussion, but with limited time, I'll do my best to moderate and allow all view points to be adequately addressed.
[00:01:25] Please raise your hand in the Zoom reactions, and I'll try and make sure we get all voices heard. I want to be
[00:01:32] respectful of everyone's time and late night time zone. So, let's aim for about a 40-minute call. I wanted to begin by
[00:01:38] welcoming our attendees. And I believe most of you have already introduced yourself. So, uh, yeah, I can see that
[00:01:46] Donald's just joined us. Um, in alphabetical order, I I just wanted
[00:01:51] to ask the attendees that are here to give us a quick summary of your relation
[00:01:58] to Ethereum Classic and less than one minute um, on your position with regards
[00:02:04] to 1559 if you have one. So, I guess we'll start with Cody.
[00:02:15] if you could just uh say hello and what do you think about 1559? I believe
[00:02:20] you're a co-author of the um Olympia. So yeah. Uh hello everyone. Kelly Burns. Uh
[00:02:27] I'm here representing the Darium Classic uh co-ops board uh point of view. That's
[00:02:35] what I've do most recently in Ethereum Classic. I've been on the board for uh
[00:02:40] the last few years. uh help coordinate things as far as the GitHub and repo and uh EIP. So
[00:02:47] uh I think are we supposed to a one minute overall view of 1500 or we're just doing interest right now?
[00:02:54] Yeah, just your opinion of it and what do you think uh very briefly a theme
[00:02:59] classic should do? Sure. uh in general I think it's uh
[00:03:06] from the discussion I like the idea of the uh smoothing algorithm that's
[00:03:12] discussed uh in the e economics package I think it's after the block reward is gone that something like that would be
[00:03:18] interesting I think it's uh in general ethereum plastic needs to have a
[00:03:25] discussion on what our future is for if uh staying compatible with the mainet
[00:03:31] Ethereum is something that's valuable or now know that their road map's going to something that's a risk based
[00:03:37] architecture with rollups. Uh is that something that still matters or is Ethereum need something different that's
[00:03:43] uh better suited for the community? So happy to have a discussion.
[00:03:49] Okay, thanks. Uh I see Diego has joined us and as the next alphabetical person
[00:03:55] uh Diego could you just quickly uh explain your role with relation to
[00:04:01] Ethereum Classic and if you have any uh opinions on how ETC should move forward
[00:04:08] with regards to 1559 if any. Yes. Um hi guys. Um yeah thank you for
[00:04:16] for joining uh today. Um yeah well well my role is I'm a a blockchain yeah
[00:04:24] protocol developer uh for for etc. Um yeah well I I posted this um proposal
[00:04:33] for how we could introduce 1559 uh in the protocol in a way that will
[00:04:39] not disrupt the current monetary policy. uh I don't know if I should go into the
[00:04:45] detail right now but uh mostly my my proposal was uh will be if we could
[00:04:51] think about uh implementing something like that I mean like distributing
[00:04:56] the the base fee in a way that will uh keep the monetary policy the current one
[00:05:04] okay thank you um and I guess Donald's next Donald could you quickly intro
[00:05:10] yourself and your opinions on 559. Thank you. I'm Donald McIntyre. When um
[00:05:18] uh Ethereum and ETC separated, I actually stayed with Ethereum until 2018. And in 2018, I was hired by uh ETC
[00:05:28] Dev to do business development and marketing. ETC Dev was the core
[00:05:34] developer team of Ethereum Classic. So, ever since I've been with Ethereum Classic. Uh in early 2019, I started to
[00:05:42] write about Ethereum Classic and my main role has been to write be like a blogger for Ethereum
[00:05:49] Classic, writing articles and explaining all my vision about Ethereum Classic ever since. And and then I was hired by
[00:05:55] the ETC cooperative for two years where I wrote all my whole vision for Ethereum
[00:06:01] Classic on the ethereum.org website. I think it's more than 200 articles
[00:06:07] and another similar number of videos about these things. Um, with regard to
[00:06:16] EIP1559, I thought it was a bad idea for Ethereum at the time. I think that the
[00:06:23] that the underlying goals were were naive. I I believe in the free market
[00:06:30] and not setting fees by algorithm. I
[00:06:35] prefer I prefer the old system. So my preference would be not to implement EIP1559.
[00:06:43] Um but Cody said something very important which is up to what extent do we want to be
[00:06:50] compatible with Ethereum. And um Diego has explained to me in previous meetings
[00:06:57] that we had um that DIP559 does not only
[00:07:02] change the fees but introduce a new transaction type and that transaction type is widely used in Ethereum and that
[00:07:09] it has some features that actually are important for the building of DAP.
[00:07:16] So I I would I would be flexible to implementing EIP559
[00:07:22] up to that extent. Okay. Um I will go next as I'm next in
[00:07:30] alphabetical order. I'm a store longtime contributor to ETC. I've been helping organize community resources like the
[00:07:37] website and organizing community calls. Originally, my stance uh was to if we
[00:07:44] were going to implement 1559 to just burn the fees, but have since been convinced by reading Diego's post that
[00:07:51] that is not really an option because we have a fixed emission curve. And unlike
[00:07:57] Ethereum, we need I believe all the uh incentive
[00:08:03] to go to miners to continue mining the chain. And as Cody mentioned, something like an L-shaped curve seems like the
[00:08:11] most reasonable and simple way to do that without introducing um problems with relation to myopic
[00:08:18] mining. So with a deeper understanding thanks to that post by Diego um I've
[00:08:24] kind of changed my mind if we are to implement EIP559
[00:08:29] um and if compatibility is like a a critical thing. Um but
[00:08:38] in any case I think the most important thing is maintaining um security of the chain above all.
[00:08:47] So uh we also have SP um so Phil next in the alpec order if
[00:08:56] you have any comments on 1559 and um for our myself and of our
[00:09:04] company. So um uh we don't have a position um or against or on this um
[00:09:13] let's say this um EIP59 but for um personally I think the path
[00:09:22] towards the um upgrade to let's say to a more modern
[00:09:29] way of plastic with um more as possible to have
[00:09:37] the upgraded way but for the um yeah and non safe I don't have too much comments
[00:09:45] on that and as for other company
[00:09:54] okay and thank you for that and stealth did you have any comments on that
[00:10:01] oh I'm just here to Okay, awesome. Well, I guess um
[00:10:08] I would like to I think that there's there's to break
[00:10:14] down the options. Uh the the default position is do nothing, which is not
[00:10:20] implementing 1559. And perhaps Diego, you can um explain a little bit deeper
[00:10:28] about why that might not be a good option. I know there's the a new transaction type that uh Donald
[00:10:36] mentioned. Do you think that um compatibility
[00:10:43] is uh is going to be at stake if if it's not implemented going forward?
[00:10:51] Well, yes, actually. Yeah, that's that's was my point about uh why I decided to move forward and propose something with
[00:10:57] regards on implementing 1559. Um the thing is that the problem is not only
[00:11:03] the usage of uh type two transactions because that in a way that's something that we can keep avoiding because legacy
[00:11:11] transactions still works and that's fine and that's something useful so far but
[00:11:16] the problem is that uh with the progress of Ethereum there were also introduced new type of transactions like 7702 and
[00:11:24] there are some others uh upcoming. Uh recently there was the um EOF discussion
[00:11:31] that um that also we're introducing another uh type of transaction and all
[00:11:37] of these new transactions in a way or another uses the same mechanisms of base
[00:11:43] fees. So um the 1559 transactions were like the most simple implementation that
[00:11:50] like just have the very same mechanism that we already had but using a different market fee. But for the new
[00:11:56] features that they are introducing and we could hopefully add and they are really important for for a network like
[00:12:04] ours uh all of them uses the very same concepts. So the the best approach for
[00:12:12] this is to follow their their own their same path that they went through. I mean
[00:12:17] to implement like the the most simple transaction type for this new market fee
[00:12:24] and then move forward. uh using the same ideas that we have we could decide for
[00:12:30] implementing 1559. So that's why I think it's important to start thinking about
[00:12:35] this.
[00:12:40] Understood. Yeah. I think um it seems like there's not really much of
[00:12:47] an option if we do want to maintain compatibility uh going forward, which I believe is a goal. and uh definitely
[00:12:55] provides value. Yes. I mean just to add some other uh
[00:13:01] aspect of this, we could maybe introduce the same type of like as I say uh 7702
[00:13:09] which is for account abstractions. We could invent our own way of implementing
[00:13:15] 50 uh 7702 but it will not be compatible. So it we
[00:13:22] will be in the same position. I mean it it will be a lot of uh burden on our
[00:13:28] development teams and protocol and research and all of that and that's something that we don't want.
[00:13:34] Okay. And what is the current state um of the op code? I remember something
[00:13:40] about there just being a zero or null value used at some point or that
[00:13:45] no so far the base fee op code is like a non-existent one. Um so if you put um
[00:13:54] an smart contract having that op code it will basically the same to or having a
[00:14:00] non-existent op code it will fail as any yeah as a non-existing op code. So yeah
[00:14:05] there is no behavior that with that regard. So so that means that currently there
[00:14:12] there may be existing contracts that are not compatible that are not deployable to etc because they're not using this op
[00:14:18] code. Yeah, I mean you could deploy whatever you want, but it will not execute.
[00:14:24] I see. I see. And just as an an example for listeners, there may be contract
[00:14:30] systems in the future that use the base fee for market dynamics and other such
[00:14:36] uh more complicated I guess interactions in the future.
[00:14:42] Yeah, probably. But something else that's interesting about a base fee that
[00:14:47] it's also uh something that will help you to measure the load of the network
[00:14:52] too and that's something interesting for for some applications. So it's not only something that will
[00:15:00] give you information about the market feed but if that value is high or low with respect with some uh target value
[00:15:07] of the block it will give you an idea of the load of the network that may open new use cases that were not yeah I don't
[00:15:15] know exploded yet. Okay thanks that makes sense. I saw Cody
[00:15:21] that you had your hand up. I did. I was going to let it hold on.
[00:15:29] Sorry, I'm at an airport. Uh, yeah, I completely agree with you now. Uh, I
[00:15:36] mean, I guess where I'm at in the this whole what do we need to do is that we've it's
[00:15:43] no longer a a computing problem or a a silicone problem. The code is there. We
[00:15:48] could implement it if we wanted to. It's as a community, we need to figure out what Is ETC going to be a world computer
[00:15:55] that's powered by proof of work or is it a peer-to-peer cash system that's a more
[00:16:01] efficient or a more programmable Bitcoin version and 2018 2022 this was a different
[00:16:08] conversation that we thought we would have been having uh but we're in a new reality now this is postgenus act uh
[00:16:15] we're declaring act will come out at some point later this year so every bank
[00:16:20] globally or every financial institution is trying to figure out how they custody assets, how they start bringing these
[00:16:27] onto their books so that like Tesla, they can hold Bitcoin or they can use stable coins to accept payments. So,
[00:16:34] it's every company right now is it's Bitcoin and Ethereum is what everyone wants to bring. They're the major ones,
[00:16:41] but whenever they start talking about what's the wave two of coins that platform support, ETC needs to be in
[00:16:47] that conversation. So this is kind of the defining moment of uh do we how do
[00:16:52] we reposition ourselves as a chain that's not a scam and uh is active in
[00:16:58] doing development and not falling behind. So that's I am a co-author of
[00:17:04] the uh Olympic or Olympus uh EIP. I
[00:17:09] think it having sustainable funding is good. I think it's not I guess relevant to 1559 or the two
[00:17:16] are separate issues. you can implement one without the other or do something uh mechanically. The funding is something
[00:17:21] that so I have happier talk about later but I don't think it's relevant here.
[00:17:27] Can I can I jump in there because as far as I understood Olympia
[00:17:32] fully relies on whether or not 1551 is implemented and sorry 1559 is
[00:17:38] implemented and how it's implemented. i.e. if those if the base fee goes to a
[00:17:44] DAO then it's not going to the miners. So Olympia as a funding mechanism
[00:17:51] requires kind of like twoinone hard fork both doing 1559 and also redirecting those
[00:18:00] base fees to a DAO. So it it does a current implementation but
[00:18:06] it can only be a percentage. That's what Zcash is out. It's just a percentage of whatever the reward is. So it doesn't have to be the full base fee. Be a 3% of
[00:18:13] the base fee or some arbitrary percentage that we negotiate out with each other later. But it doesn't have to
[00:18:20] be the full base fee. Half the base fee could go to whatever. It's just code uh getting agree on what we want the code
[00:18:26] to do. It's the probably harder part than figuring out how to make the math work. Okay.
[00:18:31] But you could Yeah, you do need something like 1559 implemented for it to work. But in general 1559 could be
[00:18:38] implemented with or without uh splitting the base view or it could be done by some people a lot smarter than us a long
[00:18:45] time from now. So I see. So we we could say that like uh
[00:18:52] we've it would be easier to reach consensus that we need to implement 1559 as a
[00:18:58] standalone step before uh tying it to any Dows basically and
[00:19:04] having a more simple implementation first and then maybe later down the line. I mean to begin with there's not
[00:19:11] going to be any base there's not going to be much of a base fee anyway. So sending it to a Dow is kind of
[00:19:16] meaningless but your position I guess would be maybe in the future.
[00:19:22] Yeah, I mean it's symbolic I guess sending to D now it's it's it's pennies uh now that the co-op's restructured and
[00:19:30] uh the ETC DAO uh group and others are
[00:19:35] uh going to be supporting developers and it's it's not a pressing matter. It is
[00:19:41] something I believe needs to happen long term, but it's not uh worth throwing the baby out with the bath water.
[00:19:48] I see. And I think that would make it easier to to have a
[00:19:54] uh what's the phrase? Like a a compment a compartmentalized discussion about
[00:20:00] 1559 in a way that's not sort of tainted. So it's easy to reach alignment within the
[00:20:06] community about this. Yeah, it's best to have outrage about one thing at a time.
[00:20:13] We can all get agree on uh doing something that's technically good for the network. And
[00:20:19] I think that that's worth worth the squeeze right now.
[00:20:24] Is this a security advisory? Please maintain position of your base at all times.
[00:20:31] Yeah. Um, I think is is there anyone on this call that is
[00:20:37] like I mean Donald seemed to be uh somewhat against it at first but now
[00:20:44] potentially is open to uh implementing something similar to 1559. I guess the
[00:20:51] the next step in the discussion is like what would be the like most basic
[00:20:58] implementation technically that is like economically sound. Um I'm assuming that
[00:21:06] burning that fee is not economically sound. I mean, it's possible, but
[00:21:12] a couple of the problems highlighted by Diego would be changing the monetary
[00:21:17] supply and then also requiring um
[00:21:24] like the only way that miners would be receiving any reward for a block as the
[00:21:30] emission goes down is through the priority fees, which in most cases
[00:21:36] probably would not be a thing unless all the blocks are fully congested. Do I
[00:21:41] understand that correctly, Diego? Yes. If we burn F that will be the only
[00:21:47] Yeah. incentive for the miners. Yeah.
[00:21:54] So, so basically, um, as the commission, as the subsidy goes down, if the fee is
[00:22:01] burned or directed away, then there's like no incentive to to mine Ethereum
[00:22:06] Classic, which I don't think is a reasonable option. So, the only alternative is is to give miners the
[00:22:12] fees back. No, at least for now.
[00:22:19] Yes, I think that that was the the thing that we could thought on how to implement this. Um, well, I think I
[00:22:26] mentioned this in the in the in the post there, but uh it was considered at a
[00:22:32] point in Ethereum to implement 1559 this way. So it's not something that doesn't
[00:22:37] have any sustain at least in some broader community
[00:22:42] and and that that basic implementation would be using an L curve.
[00:22:50] Um what do you mean by L curve? Uh like the smoothing curve over N blocks instead of just on the same
[00:22:57] blocks. Uh yes. Yes. Yeah. splitting among like
[00:23:02] for the upcoming end miners from the future.
[00:23:07] Yes, I don't know yet if that will be in a linear way or Yeah, it's something that we have to to discuss. I think like
[00:23:15] something um equal for every minor in the future will be something
[00:23:21] I don't know pretty okay and simple at least to begin with. Yeah, it seems like the most simple
[00:23:29] ungameable or at least less gameable approach. I'm not sure if it fully
[00:23:36] disincentivized myopic mining over like midterm.
[00:23:41] Uh if there's like a large mining pool, they still might be incentivized to uh
[00:23:47] to publish transactions. Yes. Because the the idea is that in the
[00:23:52] end I mean in the long term every participant every minor will get the same because the pool will be equally
[00:24:00] distributed among like the pool of miners participating. So eventually in
[00:24:05] the long term everyone will get the the same. I mean assuming like a pretty
[00:24:11] equal distribution of transactions fees among the the the life of the network
[00:24:16] but thinking I mean at least it's pretty fair for everyone. Mhm. Yeah. Is there is it
[00:24:23] sorry please? Yeah sorry wanted to jump in real quick. there is an alternative I guess that's
[00:24:29] being discussed uh not in Ethereum plastic but just broadly in the bigger
[00:24:34] blockchain ecosystem right now uh Zcash uh finally published their the NSM the
[00:24:40] network sustainability mechanism uh and it's for their uh emission curve since
[00:24:46] they're a fixed supply too this smooths out the stair step of it so that miners have
[00:24:53] a smoother curve more predictability and then the long term is that uh the emissions last or block
[00:25:00] rewards last longer until the transaction can support themselves. So it's uh it's a different way of or of
[00:25:06] getting to the same goal of we want miners to be aligned with the long-term incentives of the network. So I think
[00:25:13] you can either go with something like NSM or you can do something like the L curve on the the base fee. I like the
[00:25:20] the curve better because it it uh it incentivizes based off how much the
[00:25:25] network's used. So miners get paid the more the networks use and everyone uh I
[00:25:31] think it works better longer term because block rewards eventually run out and then you want something that's sustainable.
[00:25:39] Yeah. And it seems pretty like the least simple good option as far as I can tell
[00:25:44] unless I'm missing any other options.
[00:25:52] And is there any like uh research or modeling being done into the
[00:25:58] actual numbers to be used as like how many blocks in the future that is
[00:26:05] smoothed out to? Yeah. No, no. Uh in the paper there is a
[00:26:10] mention of uh 1,000 or so. I think it's it's a bit too much. Um also we have to
[00:26:19] measure of the impacts on the client because um if we are going to use uh 1,00 blocks that means that we will have
[00:26:27] to have that 1,000 blocks accessible in the memory of the client. So it's
[00:26:32] something that will will have some impact on the footprint in the execution. So it's something that we have to measure pretty well about what
[00:26:40] will give us enough security and will not uh put too much load into the
[00:26:45] client. So it's something up to yeah research yet but still yeah right
[00:26:50] Diego still just bas as the clients or I mean does getting being Ethereum
[00:26:58] compatible get us any benefits of being able to use other clients or nodes or anything like that?
[00:27:04] Um do you mean with regards to 1559 or in general? uh in general uh we've made
[00:27:11] a big deal about we're aligned to uh Ethereum we're code compatible so I mean
[00:27:16] DAPs can deploy smart contracts can deploy wallets can connect but like as far as the actual infrastructure we're
[00:27:22] running are we still uh does we when Ethereum did their merge they split the
[00:27:28] execution and consensus clients so you can mix and match any consensus with any
[00:27:33] execution agent can Ethereum classic use any of those execution agents or we still
[00:27:40] No, no, no. Um, coreg gas it's quite different than go ethereum nowadays more
[00:27:45] and more every day because they are removing a lot of uh code waste from proof of work. On the basis side, uh we
[00:27:53] are still in the upstream as um like I guess a flag for enabling um the the
[00:28:00] compatibility with uh Ethereum Classic. And those are the only two clients that we have so far. And if we were going to
[00:28:08] add ETC uh for some other execution clients, we will have to do some work
[00:28:13] like in Ethermine or Nethermine or or Aragon or or any of the others. Um some
[00:28:20] of the others are more uh friendly to extensions uh than go Ethereum but uh
[00:28:26] there is no work being done into that. Um I think Isak at some point uh he did
[00:28:32] some effort on uh including the etc layer of compatibility in argon
[00:28:38] but I probably was uh that's really outdated now. So yep.
[00:28:45] Okay. I mean I guess that goes to the other point of the other option is we could make a reduced version of Ethereum
[00:28:52] plastic use uh not try to keep up with everything keep our current functionality and
[00:28:59] be as hard coding as we can around everything and still do 1559 but lock it
[00:29:04] down for the longer term and not try to be support everything that Ethereum does
[00:29:10] after this. Yes. Um I think at some point we will
[00:29:15] need to make a decision of uh to continue uh over which client I think um
[00:29:22] with every day is becoming more and more difficult to merge um go ethereum with
[00:29:27] the corg uh codebase um and I think in the long term that doesn't scale too well because
[00:29:34] it's really complex it's really errorprone and there are not many people capable of handling those enormous
[00:29:41] merges. So eventually the idea might be to make some research uh on top of the
[00:29:48] other clients and see which client is the more friendlier
[00:29:53] for for including other networks uh having like a small merge um that yeah
[00:30:00] to solve that problem in the long term. Do do other blockchains have multiple
[00:30:08] implementations or like I guess I'm thinking like polygon or the optimism stack. It seems like or Salana most of
[00:30:15] them kind of align to like there's one client and then all the development effort can be focused on that. Would
[00:30:21] that maybe be a better model for us than trying to spread out and have as many clients as possible?
[00:30:27] Uh maybe but still we will need uh some upstream to rely on um because it's for
[00:30:36] me at least go Ethereum and never looking at them. It's uh like even a security issue
[00:30:43] because they will be they keep fixing things and all of that and adding new features and improving the execution of
[00:30:51] the overall engine and I think we will need to to be tied to some client. Uh
[00:30:57] ideally it will it should be a client that will embrace us as partners or
[00:31:03] being part of the same community of developers. Um, so that's that's what I think. I'm not
[00:31:10] against having or supporting a single client, but I think it should be part of some other bigger community of devs.
[00:31:18] Yeah. And the reason why I'm I guess asking this is right now we have the
[00:31:24] developer and the others are being hired by other companies that can support
[00:31:30] whatever we implement, but it's it's a limited group of people. we have limited skills. So if Basu and if Diego, if
[00:31:38] you're a Java developer and Basu is where you want to go, then maybe that's what we should focus on. Uh since you're
[00:31:45] our core dev right now and or look at Mantis and see if we can write it, but it was custom built for us and just be
[00:31:51] our own upstream from there. I haven't thought about Mantis in years, but it's still around, I'm sure.
[00:31:58] [Music] Yeah. Um yeah I think it's it's up to discussion
[00:32:04] and also if um the etc grandsty is going to hire two new people I think it's a
[00:32:11] discussion to have with them too uh what they will be yeah what they want to do
[00:32:17] and what will be our f focus on the on the near future.
[00:32:27] I I wanted to sorry please go ahead. I've drifted away from our 1559
[00:32:33] conversation. So I apologize but uh I haven't heard anyone violently disagree
[00:32:38] that we need to start discussing how it gets implemented though. Um I would like to hear from you Donald you have the
[00:32:45] written the most on your overall vision of everything. So um like to hear your input on everything. I think it's a good
[00:32:51] idea to to isolate the the next step to EIP559.
[00:32:59] I support it because of the reasons that were explained here today. Uh I think Diego expanded more on on not only it's
[00:33:07] a transaction type that is widely used but also it has things that are going to
[00:33:13] be used in future transaction types. So um and I agree with um
[00:33:19] um Histora that uh compatibility is still important.
[00:33:29] So I would agree with EIP559 on ETC.
[00:33:34] Awesome. I I also wanted to throw in another potential opportunity if 1559 or a new
[00:33:43] version of it for etc is implemented and that is the question of
[00:33:49] how big the maximum block size can be. And I know on Ethereum they settled on
[00:33:55] like double the target block size, but I was thinking that maybe it would be
[00:34:03] um wise to think about different variables for that. And this also might tie into Donald's idea about having more
[00:34:11] of a a fixed uh gas um limit or gas target in in the client
[00:34:19] itself as opposed to variable gas. But I just wanted to throw these ideas out there. The idea of having like a maybe
[00:34:26] four times or even greater maximum block size would allow for extremely
[00:34:32] complicated uh deployments to occur with massive contracts that would otherwise not be
[00:34:38] possible. Um and this goes back to previous discussions we've had about um
[00:34:43] Ethereum having larger big blocks. Um, but we could achieve the same outcome
[00:34:49] with the same like total gas emission just by having like a more stretchy
[00:34:56] blocks but with a the same target blocks.
[00:35:04] You mean to fix to fix to fix the block type in terms of gap fix the gap limit
[00:35:10] uh so that miners can't use it anymore? Well, there's two there's two elements
[00:35:16] to this. One is just the the maximum block size versus the target block size.
[00:35:22] And in Ethereum, it's doubled the target block size, but we could have it much larger, for example. And it would still
[00:35:29] have the same target block size. And another separate issue which could also be tied into the same hard fork is
[00:35:37] having a fixed target gas limit such that your goal Donald is achieved of
[00:35:44] making it more difficult for miners to just like have have huge blocks.
[00:35:52] Um I I just want to add something about this. uh probably we will need another
[00:35:57] session for discussing this but still I mean we can briefly talk about this uh I
[00:36:03] think that uh having variable or or mining miners controlling um the the
[00:36:09] block size uh was part was also part of u a protective mechanism for the for the
[00:36:15] network uh because uh it it will allow yeah faster um coordination among the
[00:36:22] miners to for example right if we are under a huge attack uh that will blow
[00:36:27] the state or maybe tear down the uh the clients because of some bug uh on the
[00:36:34] execution side. Okay, we could tell as the miners if they could lower the the
[00:36:40] block limit at the point that the the network is able to handle and that's is much easier coordination that making a
[00:36:47] new release making everyone to deploy them and all of that. So the existence of that mechanism is not only uh for for
[00:36:55] yeah for the miners to play with but also a protective mechanism for the overall network. That's something I just
[00:37:02] wanted to mention. Okay. Uh could could the same benefit be
[00:37:08] achieved by simply having an upper limit but without a lower limit?
[00:37:14] Yeah, but um uh well actually it's an upper an upper
[00:37:21] limit right now, isn't it? Okay. I mean so yeah it said
[00:37:27] so there is a hard-coded upper limit already meaning that well no it's there is a default value uh
[00:37:34] and the miners can't override that. Um I don't think it will make too much sense
[00:37:39] for the miners to increase that too much. uh it will cause I mean problems
[00:37:45] for the network themselves. Um, right. Yeah. I mean, so far it's it's not a
[00:37:51] huge deal for them to to be able to to change that. And I think the benefit of
[00:37:58] being able to easily change it uh among this uh coordination, it's it's greater
[00:38:04] than the than the the the problems that they could have. But I'm open to to
[00:38:11] discuss this. And also I mean it's it's something that we have to research a bit more because it will also
[00:38:17] see we will need to see if that uh will affect the ankle rates and all of that.
[00:38:23] I've been reading a few uh posts online about the relationship with uh block
[00:38:28] size the limit of block size and ankle rates and all that. So maybe it's something that
[00:38:34] it deserves a a bigger uh research. I think it's important to remember that
[00:38:43] the miners um can increase arbitrarily
[00:38:49] uh the the size of blocks um but they can also arbitrarily keep
[00:38:56] them small and and actually EIP559 was motivated by the miners in Ethereum
[00:39:03] keeping the blocks small when there was a lot of demand. in 2021 I think. Um so so they they they
[00:39:12] have a bias to do one or the other. Um it's it's not only to make the blocks
[00:39:17] big. Well, as far as I know, 1559 is more
[00:39:24] about well, there's there's like the UX element for users who don't know how to
[00:39:32] like price their transactions reasonably and are frequently overpaying what they
[00:39:37] should do in order to get into a the next like reasonable block. And if
[00:39:43] miners did want to increase the gas limit massively, it would take some time. Whereas 1559 allows that to occur
[00:39:50] on a shorter time period. if I understand correctly and without them having to like go through this auction
[00:39:56] system. Um so they are related but I think they
[00:40:03] solve slightly different problems. Uh
[00:40:10] did could I uh Corey I see your hand up but I was I
[00:40:17] would like to just ask with Diego about your thoughts on the the like much
[00:40:22] larger block size flexibility concept.
[00:40:28] Is that something is is the double the size decided for any particular reason or
[00:40:34] could it be more flexible? I'm not sure. It might be related to
[00:40:39] some of the math uh behind and how um the the base fee is calculated because
[00:40:45] that's um yeah it has some uh coefficients and all that and those might be related to doubling the the
[00:40:52] target. Uh I'm not quite sure. Um okay. Yeah, there there is a really
[00:40:58] interesting set of uh discussions in the Ethereum ecosystem when they were
[00:41:03] talking about 1559. Those are around I don't know like 25 sessions where they
[00:41:10] go really deep into all of these questions and we have to to revisit those. I I watch some of them uh mostly
[00:41:18] the the first ones. Um they are really interesting and they're they touch uh really interesting topics.
[00:41:26] Awesome. Um do you think uh you'd be able to point us to those discussions? I
[00:41:32] think that might be useful in a Sure. drafting.
[00:41:38] Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Uh Cody.
[00:41:44] Yeah. Uh I'm about to have to drop here in a minute, but I wanted to point out that uh the Ethereum mainet has dealt
[00:41:51] with the making blocks big and bloaty in two different ways. The first way was
[00:41:56] with uh the Ian layer where it was a more
[00:42:01] capitalist version of people could pay and keep all the new block stores uh with whatever the the reakers network
[00:42:09] was. So all the apps could dump it out data and then the worst way of doing it when they added the blob stores to the
[00:42:14] actual blocks that the validators are going doing because that forces it to store it on everybody. So I guess I said
[00:42:22] that to say that if we lock the block size it probably create some uh economic incentive to move that
[00:42:29] junk data off chain.
[00:42:43] Okay well we have um reached that 40inut target for the for the length of the call. So
[00:42:51] at this stage I think it's been productive and I think like the next
[00:42:57] step would be to try and put together some of the some of these ideas into
[00:43:02] like a revised version of 1559 and what that might look
[00:43:07] making it compatible with Ethereum Classic. Um, I can try and summarize some of the
[00:43:15] topics we've talked about here, add it to the current discussion on the uh,
[00:43:20] Diego's post and I guess we can move on from there. If there's any final comments or things that wanted to be
[00:43:28] mentioned by anyone, uh, please do so now. Otherwise, we can wrap things up.
[00:43:35] I think the the comment by Cody uh asking what is the vision? What what is
[00:43:41] it that we want for here in classic for the future classic is an important question uh that it was not for this
[00:43:48] yeah for me to talk about that here but uh I'm going to write an article or something um considering these these
[00:43:56] things that we talk talked about today. Awesome.
[00:44:02] Uh I I would just mention that like a Yep. Please.
[00:44:07] Okay. For on add on um as a final add on it is
[00:44:13] not for the um the perspective of our company just the perspective of of
[00:44:18] myself um I think for the 159 um it it should be more suitable. Um I'm I'm more
[00:44:27] towards to the idea of um not not redistributing it to the Dell B and more
[00:44:35] toward I'm more towards to the idea of uh the diag um to to redistribute it to
[00:44:43] the minor it may be compatible easier to implement and less resistance of the
[00:44:51] miners but that is only the perspective myself it doesn't um towards the status
[00:44:56] of my company. Understood. Thanks for that, Phil. Um, I
[00:45:03] tend to agree and I think we we have like not talked about Olympia on this
[00:45:09] call. Um, I was hoping maybe uh Ronin or Freeird might have been able to join,
[00:45:15] but perhaps we can discuss it on another uh occasion. But I think one of the key
[00:45:21] takeaways from this is that as Cody mentioned, there's no like critical need to rush this decision. Um,
[00:45:30] and we can take our time at least for uh a year or two and the fees that would be
[00:45:37] raised are not going to be enough to
[00:45:42] like solve any problems in any case. So let's just uh you know let's let's do
[00:45:49] this methodically and necessarily slowly with the correct consensus gathering
[00:45:56] mechanisms and make sure that everyone's on the same page and let's not try to push anything through that's going to
[00:46:02] cause any um rifts unnecessarily.
[00:46:07] So unless there's any other further uh final comments, I think we can wrap
[00:46:12] things up and I'll summarize this call and uh add it to the discussion on GitHub.
[00:46:19] No, nothing on the side. Thank you very much, Sora, for for leading this. Thank you. Thank you Stora.
[00:46:27] Thank you. Thank Thank you all for attending and uh looking forward to future discussions.
[00:46:33] Thanks, guys. Take care. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.
