I will kick off the call with a bit of a a preamble and maybe we'll get some joiners as I'm reading this. So, I'll just get this out the way. Uh but usually I start with hello and welcome to Ethereum Classic community call. Today is the 10th of October 2025. This call is today on Zoom instead of Discord in order to cater for all regions. So, sorry for the last minute change and thanks for accommodating. The call is being recorded and will be published to YouTube. This is a special call to discuss the

00:00:32
topic of how Ethereum Classic might integrate EIP1559. The call was spurred by ongoing discussion within the ETC community and in particular by a recent post on GitHub by Diego, a core developer contributing to the Ethereum classic node clients. Diego's full post in is in discussion 541 and is recommended reading. But as a very brief summary, Ethereum mainet has lainks implemented EIP1559 which is a modified transaction fee system that improves user experience when pricing transaction during hightra

00:01:08
periods to maintain to maintain compatibility with Ethereum up codes and future smart contract patterns. It may be worth considering adopting this EIP with Ethereum Classic. I wanted this call to be a relatively free form discussion, but with limited time, I'll do my best to moderate and allow all view points to be adequately addressed. Please raise your hand in the Zoom reactions, and I'll try and make sure we get all voices heard. I want to be respectful of everyone's time and late

00:01:34
night time zone. So, let's aim for about a 40-minute call. I wanted to begin by welcoming our attendees. And I believe most of you have already introduced yourself. So, uh, yeah, I can see that Donald's just joined us. Um, in alphabetical order, I I just wanted to ask the attendees that are here to give us a quick summary of your relation to Ethereum Classic and less than one minute um, on your position with regards to 1559 if you have one. So, I guess we'll start with Cody. if you could just uh say hello and what

00:02:18
do you think about 1559? I believe you're a co-author of the um Olympia. So >> yeah. Uh hello everyone. Kelly Burns. Uh I'm here representing the Darium Classic uh co-ops board uh point of view. That's what I've do most recently in Ethereum Classic. I've been on the board for uh the last few years. uh help coordinate things as far as the GitHub and repo and uh EIP. So uh I think are we supposed to a one minute overall view of 1500 or we're just doing interest right now?

00:02:54
>> Yeah, just your opinion of it and what do you think uh very briefly a theme classic should do? >> Sure. uh in general I think it's uh from the discussion I like the idea of the uh smoothing algorithm that's discussed uh in the e economics package I think it's after the block reward is gone that something like that would be interesting I think it's uh in general ethereum plastic needs to have a discussion on what our future is for if uh staying compatible with the mainet

00:03:31
Ethereum is something that's valuable or now know that their road map's going to something that's a risk based architecture with rollups. Uh is that something that still matters or is Ethereum need something different that's uh better suited for the community? So happy to have a discussion. >> Okay, thanks. Uh I see Diego has joined us and as the next alphabetical person uh Diego could you just quickly uh explain your role with relation to Ethereum Classic and if you have any uh

00:04:06
opinions on how ETC should move forward with regards to 1559 if any. >> Yes. Um hi guys. Um yeah thank you for for joining uh today. Um yeah well well my role is I'm a a blockchain yeah protocol developer uh for for etc. Um yeah well I I posted this um proposal for how we could introduce 1559 uh in the protocol in a way that will not disrupt the current monetary policy. uh I don't know if I should go into the detail right now but uh mostly my my proposal was uh will be if we could

00:04:52
think about uh implementing something like that I mean like distributing the the base fee in a way that will uh keep the monetary policy the current one >> okay thank you um and I guess Donald's next Donald could you quickly intro yourself and your opinions on 559. >> Thank you. I'm Donald McIntyre. When um uh Ethereum and ETC separated, I actually stayed with Ethereum until 2018. And in 2018, I was hired by uh ETC Dev to do business development and marketing. ETC Dev was the core

00:05:34
developer team of Ethereum Classic. So, ever since I've been with Ethereum Classic. Uh in early 2019, I started to write about Ethereum Classic and my main role has been to write be like a blogger for Ethereum Classic, writing articles and explaining all my vision about Ethereum Classic ever since. And and then I was hired by the ETC cooperative for two years where I wrote all my whole vision for Ethereum Classic on the ethereum.org website. I think it's more than 200 articles and another similar number of videos

00:06:11
about these things. Um, with regard to EIP1559, I thought it was a bad idea for Ethereum at the time. I think that the that the underlying goals were were naive. I I believe in the free market and not setting fees by algorithm. I prefer I prefer the old system. So my preference would be not to implement EIP1559. Um but Cody said something very important which is up to what extent do we want to be compatible with Ethereum. And um Diego has explained to me in previous meetings that we had um that DIP559 does not only

00:07:03
change the fees but introduce a new transaction type and that transaction type is widely used in Ethereum and that it has some features that actually are important for the building of DAP. So I I would I would be flexible to implementing EIP559 up to that extent. >> Okay. Um I will go next as I'm next in alphabetical order. I'm a store longtime contributor to ETC. I've been helping organize community resources like the website and organizing community calls. Originally, my stance uh was to if we

00:07:44
were going to implement 1559 to just burn the fees, but have since been convinced by reading Diego's post that that is not really an option because we have a fixed emission curve. And unlike Ethereum, we need I believe all the uh incentive to go to miners to continue mining the chain. And as Cody mentioned, something like an L-shaped curve seems like the most reasonable and simple way to do that without introducing um problems with relation to myopic mining. So with a deeper understanding thanks to that post by Diego um I've

00:08:24
kind of changed my mind if we are to implement EIP559 um and if compatibility is like a a critical thing. Um but in any case I think the most important thing is maintaining um security of the chain above all. So uh we also have SP um so Phil next in the alpec order if you have any comments on 1559 >> and um for our myself and of our company. So um uh we don't have a position um or against or on this um let's say this um EIP59 but for um personally I think the path towards the um upgrade to let's say to a more modern

00:09:29
way of plastic with um more as possible to have the upgraded way but for the um yeah and non safe I don't have too much comments on that and as for other company >> okay and thank you for that and stealth did you have any comments on that >> oh I'm just here to Okay, awesome. Well, I guess um I would like to I think that there's there's to break down the options. Uh the the default position is do nothing, which is not implementing 1559. And perhaps Diego, you can um explain a little bit deeper

00:10:29
about why that might not be a good option. I know there's the a new transaction type that uh Donald mentioned. Do you think that um compatibility is uh is going to be at stake if if it's not implemented going forward? >> Well, yes, actually. Yeah, that's that's was my point about uh why I decided to move forward and propose something with regards on implementing 1559. Um the thing is that the problem is not only the usage of uh type two transactions because that in a way that's something

00:11:08
that we can keep avoiding because legacy transactions still works and that's fine and that's something useful so far but the problem is that uh with the progress of Ethereum there were also introduced new type of transactions like 7702 and there are some others uh upcoming. Uh recently there was the um EOF discussion that um that also we're introducing another uh type of transaction and all of these new transactions in a way or another uses the same mechanisms of base fees. So um the 1559 transactions were

00:11:48
like the most simple implementation that like just have the very same mechanism that we already had but using a different market fee. But for the new features that they are introducing and we could hopefully add and they are really important for for a network like ours uh all of them uses the very same concepts. So the the best approach for this is to follow their their own their same path that they went through. I mean to implement like the the most simple transaction type for this new market fee

00:12:24
and then move forward. uh using the same ideas that we have we could decide for implementing 1559. So that's why I think it's important to start thinking about this. Understood. Yeah. I think um it seems like there's not really much of an option if we do want to maintain compatibility uh going forward, which I believe is a goal. and uh definitely provides value. >> Yes. I mean just to add some other uh aspect of this, we could maybe introduce the same type of like as I say uh 7702

00:13:10
which is for account abstractions. We could invent our own way of implementing 50 uh 7702 but it will not be compatible. So it we will be in the same position. I mean it it will be a lot of uh burden on our development teams and protocol and research and all of that and that's something that we don't want. >> Okay. And what is the current state um of the op code? I remember something about there just being a zero or null value used at some point or that >> no so far the base fee op code is like a

00:13:49
non-existent one. Um so if you put um an smart contract having that op code it will basically the same to or having a non-existent op code it will fail as any yeah as a non-existing op code. So yeah there is no behavior that with that regard. >> So so that means that currently there there may be existing contracts that are not compatible that are not deployable to etc because they're not using this op code. Yeah, I mean you could deploy whatever you want, but it will not execute. >> I see. I see. And just as an an example

00:14:27
for listeners, there may be contract systems in the future that use the base fee for market dynamics and other such uh more complicated I guess interactions in the future. >> Yeah, probably. But something else that's interesting about a base fee that it's also uh something that will help you to measure the load of the network too and that's something >> interesting for for some applications. So it's not only something that will give you information about the market feed but if that value is high or low

00:15:05
with respect with some uh target value of the block it will give you an idea of the load of the network that may open new use cases that were not yeah I don't know exploded yet. >> Okay thanks that makes sense. I saw Cody that you had your hand up. I did. I was going to let it hold on. >> Sorry, I'm at an airport. Uh, yeah, I completely agree with you now. Uh, I mean, I guess where I'm at in the this whole what do we need to do is that we've it's no longer a a computing problem or a a

00:15:47
silicone problem. The code is there. We could implement it if we wanted to. It's >> as a community, we need to figure out what Is ETC going to be a world computer that's powered by proof of work or is it a peer-to-peer cash system that's a more efficient or a more programmable Bitcoin version and 2018 2022 this was a different conversation that we thought we would have been having uh but we're in a new reality now this is postgenus act uh we're declaring act will come out at

00:16:17
some point later this year so every bank globally or every financial institution is trying to figure out how they custody assets, how they start bringing these onto their books so that like Tesla, they can hold Bitcoin or they can use stable coins to accept payments. So, it's every company right now is it's Bitcoin and Ethereum is what everyone wants to bring. They're the major ones, but whenever they start talking about what's the wave two of coins that platform support, ETC needs to be in

00:16:47
that conversation. So this is kind of the defining moment of uh do we how do we reposition ourselves as a chain that's not a scam and uh is active in doing development and not falling behind. So that's I am a co-author of the uh Olympic or Olympus uh EIP. I think it having sustainable funding is good. I think it's not I guess relevant to 1559 or the two are separate issues. you can implement one without the other or do something uh mechanically. The funding is something that >> so I have happier talk about later but I

00:17:25
don't think it's relevant here. >> Can I can I jump in there because as far as I understood Olympia fully relies on whether or not 1551 is implemented and sorry 1559 is implemented and how it's implemented. i.e. if those if the base fee goes to a DAO then it's not going to the miners. So Olympia as a funding mechanism requires kind of like twoinone hard fork both doing 1559 and also redirecting those base fees to a DAO. So >> it it does a current implementation but it can only be a percentage. That's what

00:18:08
Zcash is out. It's just a percentage of whatever the reward is. So it doesn't have to be the full base fee. Be a 3% of the base fee or some arbitrary percentage that we negotiate out with each other later. But it doesn't have to be the full base fee. Half the base fee could go to whatever. It's just code uh getting agree on what we want the code to do. It's the probably harder part than figuring out how to make the math work. >> Okay. >> But you could Yeah, you do need

00:18:33
something like 1559 implemented for it to work. But in general 1559 could be implemented with or without uh splitting the base view or it could be done by some people a lot smarter than us a long time from now. So >> I see. So we we could say that like uh we've it would be easier to reach consensus that we need to implement 1559 as a standalone step before uh tying it to any Dows basically and having a more simple implementation first and then maybe later down the line. I mean to begin with there's not

00:19:11
going to be any base there's not going to be much of a base fee anyway. So sending it to a Dow is kind of meaningless but >> your position I guess would be maybe in the future. >> Yeah, I mean it's symbolic I guess sending to D now it's it's it's pennies uh now that the co-op's restructured and uh the ETC DAO uh group and others are uh going to be supporting developers and it's it's not a pressing matter. It is something I believe needs to happen long

00:19:43
term, but it's not uh worth throwing the baby out with the bath water. >> I see. And I think that would make it easier to to have a uh what's the phrase? Like a a compment a compartmentalized discussion about 1559 in a way that's not sort of tainted. So it's easy to reach alignment within the community about this. Yeah, it's best to have outrage about one thing at a time. >> We can all get agree on uh doing something that's technically good for the network. And

00:20:20
>> I think that that's worth worth the squeeze right now. >> Is this a security advisory? Please maintain position of your base at all times. >> Yeah. Um, I think is is there anyone on this call that is like I mean Donald seemed to be uh somewhat against it at first but now potentially is open to uh implementing something similar to 1559. I guess the the next step in the discussion is like what would be the like most basic implementation technically that is like economically sound. Um I'm assuming that

00:21:06
burning that fee is not economically sound. I mean, it's possible, but a couple of the problems highlighted by Diego would be changing the monetary supply and then also requiring um like the only way that miners would be receiving any reward for a block as the emission goes down is through the priority fees, which in most cases probably would not be a thing unless all the blocks are fully congested. Do I understand that correctly, Diego? >> Yes. If we burn F that will be the only Yeah. incentive for the miners.

00:21:50
>> Yeah. So, so basically, um, as the commission, as the subsidy goes down, if the fee is burned or directed away, then there's like no incentive to to mine Ethereum Classic, which I don't think is a reasonable option. So, the only alternative is is to give miners the fees back. No, at least for now. Yes, I think that that was the the thing that we could thought on how to implement this. Um, well, I think I mentioned this in the in the in the post there, but uh it was considered at a

00:22:32
point in Ethereum to implement 1559 this way. So it's not something that doesn't have any sustain at least in some broader community >> and and that that basic implementation would be using an L curve. >> Um what do you mean by L curve? >> Uh like the smoothing curve over N blocks instead of just on the same blocks. >> Uh yes. Yes. Yeah. splitting among like for the upcoming end miners from the future. >> Yes, I don't know yet if that will be in a linear way or Yeah, it's something

00:23:12
that we have to to discuss. I think like something um equal for every minor in the future will be something I don't know pretty okay and simple at least to begin with. Yeah, it seems like the most simple ungameable or at least less gameable approach. I'm not sure if it fully disincentivized myopic mining over like midterm. Uh if there's like a large mining pool, they still might be incentivized to uh to publish transactions. >> Yes. Because the the idea is that in the end I mean in the long term every

00:23:55
participant every minor will get the same because the pool will be equally distributed among like the pool of miners participating. So eventually in the long term everyone will get the the same. I mean assuming like a pretty equal distribution of transactions fees among the the the life of the network but thinking I mean at least it's pretty fair for everyone. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. Is there is it >> sorry please? >> Yeah sorry wanted to jump in real quick. there is an alternative I guess that's

00:24:30
being discussed uh not in Ethereum plastic but just broadly in the bigger blockchain ecosystem right now uh Zcash uh finally published their the NSM the network sustainability mechanism uh and it's for their uh emission curve since they're a fixed supply too this smooths out the stair step of it so that miners have a smoother curve more predictability and then the long term is that uh the emissions last or block rewards last longer until the transaction can support themselves. So it's uh it's a different way of or of

00:25:07
getting to the same goal of we want miners to be aligned with the long-term incentives of the network. So I think you can either go with something like NSM or you can do something like the L curve on the the base fee. I like the the curve better because it it uh it incentivizes based off how much the network's used. So miners get paid the more the networks use and everyone uh I think it works better longer term because block rewards eventually run out and then you want something that's sustainable.

00:25:39
Yeah. And it seems pretty like the least simple good option as far as I can tell unless I'm missing any other options. And is there any like uh research or modeling being done into the actual numbers to be used as like how many blocks in the future that is smoothed out to? >> Yeah. No, no. Uh in the paper there is a mention of uh 1,000 or so. I think it's it's a bit too much. Um also we have to measure of the impacts on the client because um if we are going to use uh 1,00 blocks that means that we will have

00:26:27
to have that 1,000 blocks accessible in the memory of the client. So it's something that will will have some impact on the footprint in the execution. So it's something that we have to measure pretty well about what will give us enough security and will not uh put too much load into the client. So it's something up to yeah research yet but still yeah >> right >> Diego still just bas as the clients >> or I mean does getting being Ethereum compatible get us any benefits of being

00:27:00
able to use other clients or nodes or anything like that? >> Um do you mean with regards to 1559 or in general? uh in general uh we've made a big deal about we're aligned to uh Ethereum we're code compatible so I mean DAPs can deploy smart contracts can deploy wallets can connect but like as far as the actual infrastructure we're running are we still uh does we when Ethereum did their merge they split the execution and consensus clients so you can mix and match any consensus with any

00:27:33
execution agent can Ethereum classic use any of those execution agents or we still No, no, no. Um, coreg gas it's quite different than go ethereum nowadays more and more every day because they are removing a lot of uh code waste from proof of work. On the basis side, uh we are still in the upstream as um like I guess a flag for enabling um the the compatibility with uh Ethereum Classic. And those are the only two clients that we have so far. And if we were going to add ETC uh for some other execution

00:28:11
clients, we will have to do some work like in Ethermine or Nethermine or or Aragon or or any of the others. Um some of the others are more uh friendly to extensions uh than go Ethereum but uh there is no work being done into that. Um I think Isak at some point uh he did some effort on uh including the etc layer of compatibility in argon but I probably was uh that's really outdated now. So yep. >> Okay. I mean I guess that goes to the other point of the other option is we could make a reduced version of Ethereum

00:28:52
plastic use uh not try to keep up with everything keep our current functionality and >> be as hard coding as we can around everything and still do 1559 but lock it down for the longer term and not try to be support everything that Ethereum does after this. >> Yes. Um I think at some point we will need to make a decision of uh to continue uh over which client I think um with every day is becoming more and more difficult to merge um go ethereum with the corg uh codebase um and I think in the long

00:29:32
term that doesn't scale too well because it's really complex it's really errorprone and there are not many people capable of handling those enormous merges. So eventually the idea might be to make some research uh on top of the other clients and see which client is the more friendlier for for including other networks uh having like a small merge um that yeah to solve that problem in the long term. >> Do do other blockchains have multiple implementations or like I guess I'm

00:30:11
thinking like polygon or the optimism stack. It seems like or Salana most of them kind of align to like there's one client and then all the development effort can be focused on that. Would that maybe be a better model for us than trying to spread out and have as many clients as possible? >> Uh maybe but still we will need uh some upstream to rely on um because it's for me at least go Ethereum and never looking at them. It's uh like even a security issue because they will be they keep fixing

00:30:46
things and all of that and adding new features and improving the execution of the overall engine and I think we will need to to be tied to some client. Uh ideally it will it should be a client that will embrace us as partners or being part of the same community of developers. Um, so that's that's what I think. I'm not against having or supporting a single client, but I think it should be part of some other bigger community of devs. >> Yeah. And the reason why I'm I guess asking this is right now we have the

00:31:25
developer and the others are being hired by other companies that can support whatever we implement, but it's it's a limited group of people. we have limited skills. So if Basu and if Diego, if you're a Java developer and Basu is where you want to go, then maybe that's what we should focus on. Uh since you're our core dev right now and or look at Mantis and see if we can write it, but it was custom built for us and just be our own upstream from there. I haven't thought about Mantis in years, but it's

00:31:56
still around, I'm sure. [Music] >> Yeah. Um yeah I think it's it's up to discussion and also if um the etc grandsty is going to hire two new people I think it's a discussion to have with them too uh what they will be yeah what they want to do and what will be our f focus on the on the near future. I I wanted to sorry please go ahead. >> I've drifted away from our 1559 conversation. So I apologize but uh I haven't heard anyone violently disagree that we need to start discussing how it

00:32:40
gets implemented though. Um I would like to hear from you Donald you have the written the most on your overall vision of everything. So um like to hear your input on everything. I think it's a good idea to to isolate the the next step to EIP559. I support it because of the reasons that were explained here today. Uh I think Diego expanded more on on not only it's a transaction type that is widely used but also it has things that are going to be used in future transaction types. So um and I agree with um

00:33:20
um Histora that uh compatibility is still important. >> So I would agree with EIP559 on ETC. >> Awesome. I I also wanted to throw in another potential opportunity if 1559 or a new version of it for etc is implemented and that is the question of how big the maximum block size can be. And I know on Ethereum they settled on like double the target block size, but I was thinking that maybe it would be um wise to think about different variables for that. And this also might tie into Donald's idea about having more

00:34:11
of a a fixed uh gas um limit or gas target in in the client itself as opposed to variable gas. But I just wanted to throw these ideas out there. The idea of having like a maybe four times or even greater maximum block size would allow for extremely complicated uh deployments to occur with massive contracts that would otherwise not be possible. Um and this goes back to previous discussions we've had about um Ethereum having larger big blocks. Um, but we could achieve the same outcome with the same like total gas emission

00:34:54
just by having like a more stretchy blocks but with a the same target blocks. >> You mean to fix to fix to fix the block type in terms of gap fix the gap limit >> uh so that miners can't use it anymore? Well, there's two there's two elements to this. One is just the the maximum block size versus the target block size. And in Ethereum, it's doubled the target block size, but we could have it much larger, for example. And it would still have the same target block size. And

00:35:32
another separate issue which could also be tied into the same hard fork is having a fixed target gas limit such that your goal Donald is achieved of making it more difficult for miners to just like have have huge blocks. >> Um I I just want to add something about this. uh probably we will need another session for discussing this but still I mean we can briefly talk about this uh I think that uh having variable or or mining miners controlling um the the block size uh was part was also part of

00:36:13
u a protective mechanism for the for the network uh because uh it it will allow yeah faster um coordination among the miners to for example right if we are under a huge attack uh that will blow the state or maybe tear down the uh the clients because of some bug uh on the execution side. Okay, we could tell as the miners if they could lower the the block limit at the point that the the network is able to handle and that's is much easier coordination that making a new release making everyone to deploy

00:36:50
them and all of that. So the existence of that mechanism is not only uh for for yeah for the miners to play with but also a protective mechanism for the overall network. That's something I just wanted to mention. >> Okay. Uh could could the same benefit be achieved by simply having an upper limit but without a lower limit? Yeah, but um uh well actually it's an upper an upper limit right now, isn't it? Okay. >> I mean so yeah it said >> so there is a hard-coded upper limit

00:37:29
already meaning that >> well no it's there is a default value uh and the miners can't override that. Um I don't think it will make too much sense for the miners to increase that too much. uh it will cause I mean problems for the network themselves. Um, right. >> Yeah. I mean, so far it's it's not a huge deal for them to to be able to to change that. And I think the benefit of being able to easily change it uh among this uh coordination, it's it's greater than the than the the the problems that

00:38:08
they could have. But I'm open to to discuss this. And also I mean it's it's something that we have to research a bit more because it will also see we will need to see if that uh will affect the ankle rates and all of that. I've been reading a few uh posts online about the relationship with uh block size the limit of block size and ankle rates and all that. So maybe it's something that >> it deserves a a bigger uh research. I think it's important to remember that the miners

00:38:45
um can increase arbitrarily uh the the size of blocks um but they can also arbitrarily keep them small and and actually EIP559 was motivated by the miners in Ethereum keeping the blocks small when there was a lot of demand. in 2021 I think. Um so so they they they have a bias to do one or the other. Um it's it's not only to make the blocks big. Well, as far as I know, 1559 is more about well, there's there's like the UX element for users who don't know how to like price their transactions reasonably

00:39:35
and are frequently overpaying what they should do in order to get into a the next like reasonable block. And if miners did want to increase the gas limit massively, it would take some time. Whereas 1559 allows that to occur on a shorter time period. if I understand correctly and without them having to like go through this auction system. Um so they are related but I think they solve slightly different problems. Uh did could I uh Corey I see your hand up but I was I would like to just ask with Diego about

00:40:20
your thoughts on the the like much larger block size flexibility concept. Is that something is is the double the size decided for any particular reason or could it be more flexible? I'm not sure. It might be related to some of the math uh behind and how um the the base fee is calculated because that's um yeah it has some uh coefficients and all that and those might be related to doubling the the target. Uh I'm not quite sure. Um >> okay. >> Yeah, there there is a really interesting set of uh discussions in the

00:41:01
Ethereum ecosystem when they were talking about 1559. Those are around I don't know like 25 sessions where they go really deep into all of these questions and we have to to revisit those. I I watch some of them uh mostly the the first ones. Um they are really interesting and they're they touch uh really interesting topics. >> Awesome. Um do you think uh you'd be able to point us to those discussions? I think that might be useful in a >> Sure. drafting. >> Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:40
>> Thank you. Uh Cody. >> Yeah. Uh I'm about to have to drop here in a minute, but I wanted to point out that uh the Ethereum mainet has dealt with the making blocks big and bloaty in two different ways. The first way was with uh the Ian layer where it was a more capitalist version of people could pay and keep all the new block stores uh with whatever the the reakers network was. So all the apps could dump it out data and then the worst way of doing it when they added the blob stores to the

00:42:15
actual blocks that the validators are going doing because that forces it to store it on everybody. So I guess I said that to say that if we lock the block size it probably create some uh economic incentive to move that junk data off chain. Okay well we have um reached that 40inut target for the for the length of the call. So at this stage I think it's been productive and I think like the next step would be to try and put together some of the some of these ideas into like a revised version of 1559 and what

00:43:06
that might look making it compatible with Ethereum Classic. Um, I can try and summarize some of the topics we've talked about here, add it to the current discussion on the uh, Diego's post and I guess we can move on from there. If there's any final comments or things that wanted to be mentioned by anyone, uh, please do so now. Otherwise, we can wrap things up. I think the the comment by Cody uh asking what is the vision? What what is it that we want for here in classic for the future classic is an important

00:43:46
question uh that it was not for this yeah for me to talk about that here but uh I'm going to write an article or something um considering these these things that we talk talked about today. >> Awesome. Uh I I would just mention that like a >> Yep. Please. >> Okay. For on add on um as a final add on it is not for the um the perspective of our company just the perspective of of myself um I think for the 159 um it it should be more suitable. Um I'm I'm more towards to the idea of um not not

00:44:30
redistributing it to the Dell B and more toward I'm more towards to the idea of uh the diag um to to redistribute it to the minor it may be compatible easier to implement and less resistance of the miners but that is only the perspective myself it doesn't um towards the status of my company. >> Understood. Thanks for that, Phil. Um, I tend to agree and I think we we have like not talked about Olympia on this call. Um, I was hoping maybe uh Ronin or Freeird might have been able to join,

00:45:15
but perhaps we can discuss it on another uh occasion. But I think one of the key takeaways from this is that as Cody mentioned, there's no like critical need to rush this decision. Um, and we can take our time at least for uh a year or two and the fees that would be raised are not going to be enough to like solve any problems in any case. So let's just uh you know let's let's do this methodically and necessarily slowly with the correct consensus gathering mechanisms and make sure that everyone's

00:45:58
on the same page and let's not try to push anything through that's going to cause any um rifts unnecessarily. So unless there's any other further uh final comments, I think we can wrap things up and I'll summarize this call and uh add it to the discussion on GitHub. >> No, nothing on the side. Thank you very much, Sora, for for leading this. >> Thank you. Thank you Stora. >> Thank you. >> Thank Thank you all for attending and uh looking forward to future discussions.

00:46:34
Thanks, guys. Take care. >> Bye. >> Thank you. Bye-bye.
