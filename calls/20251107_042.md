## Call 042 — Transcript

[00:00:01] Hello and welcome to Ethereum Classic community call number 42. Today is the
[00:00:07] 7th of November 2025. This week we're going to be continuing the discussion about etc implementing a
[00:00:14] 1559 like uh mechanism.
[00:00:20] And uh if you didn't listen to last month's call, we recommend listening to that.
[00:00:26] With us on the call this week is Cody Burns, Phil, and Stacy. If any of you
[00:00:31] would like to introduce yourselves, please go ahead.
[00:00:37] Let me introduce myself first. Sam Phil from Bitman and I'm also the um um in
[00:00:44] charge of the uh ETC ecosystem of the Bitman and also um an embedded software
[00:00:51] developer in the soft uh at Bitman. And uh today I'm going to um join this
[00:00:57] meeting to um take a participant of the uh let's see uh EIP59 discussion and
[00:01:04] it's my honor to be here. Thank you. Thank you Phil.
[00:01:14] And I'll go next. I'm Cody Burns. I'm a board member on the Ethereum Classic
[00:01:20] Cooperative and uh help with just general community development and
[00:01:25] ecosystem things. Um happy to be here. Uh
[00:01:32] thanks. Thank you, Cody.
[00:01:37] Um hi, I'm Stacy. I'm also from Bitman and and um I'm working with Phil.
[00:01:43] So um basically I'm just I will just like listen to your discussion today and
[00:01:50] um we will see uh what we can do next um to make ETC better. Thank you.
[00:01:59] Thank you Stacy. And uh I'm longtime contributor to etc and
[00:02:07] currently trying to uh shape discussion for the next step for etc. and we're now
[00:02:13] focusing on this 1559 question uh of which there are a number of different options that we will be exploring in
[00:02:20] this call. So I guess just as a recap in the last
[00:02:25] call if I remember correctly we basically got to the conclusion that we probably want something like 1559 for
[00:02:32] compatibility and uh interoperability with upstream Ethereum in terms of op
[00:02:39] calls and wallets and integrations and that kind of thing. So the next question
[00:02:45] is exactly what kind of mechanism we implement because we can't copy exactly
[00:02:52] Ethereum in that they're burning the transaction fees and that would mess
[00:02:57] with the Ethereum Classic commission schedule and um because we have a the
[00:03:06] uh ECIP 1 017
[00:03:11] which uh implements an emission curve. we kind of rely on transaction fees in
[00:03:17] the future to incentivize mining. So,
[00:03:23] we need to figure out a way of how to um integrate transaction fees um without
[00:03:31] fully burning them in the future. That's my position at least. Um
[00:03:38] as far as I understand, we have four options on the table at the moment. One is uh smoothing over a period of
[00:03:46] blocks which was discussed in one of the papers. Again you can reference the the
[00:03:51] notes for last week. Another is Olympia which is a treasury
[00:03:57] system. Another is an idea I came up with since the last call which is a kind of
[00:04:03] reservoir system. And another that core C Cory talked about potentially is a hybrid approach
[00:04:10] combining the different mechanisms together. So that might include Olympia plus smoothing end blocks or um yeah
[00:04:19] just a combination of the above. So were there any other options on the
[00:04:25] table before I continue discussion and talk about Olympia
[00:04:31] or are there any other comments before we move ahead?
[00:04:37] No other options I can I'm aware of. Well, I guess the other option is do
[00:04:43] nothing, but that would definitely prevent us from um the advantages of
[00:04:49] being interoperable with Ethereum. And I think we kind of decided that wasn't a good option.
[00:05:02] So, um, we didn't get much chance to talk about Olympia last week, last sorry, last month. So, I thought it might be a
[00:05:10] good time to like open up discussion about that,
[00:05:21] uh, yeah. So, I guess the main thing that I already
[00:05:28] alluded to was the um transaction fees and relying on those in
[00:05:34] the future. And uh I I pasted a link into the chat about
[00:05:40] uh visualizing future rewards. Mhm. Both the block subsidy and the the total
[00:05:48] block reward, which is the subsidy plus the transaction fees.
[00:05:54] And if we assume there's no transaction fees and a fixed price of $20 US per
[00:06:00] ETC, uh we see that the the block the total
[00:06:07] block rewards are going down considerably in the next few
[00:06:13] years if we only if we only rely on um
[00:06:19] the the emission curve. So either the price has to go up a lot
[00:06:25] in which case the problem is shifted further into the future or we need to
[00:06:32] utilize the transaction fees in some way as a more sustainable incentive for
[00:06:38] miners to to mine further down the line in the future. So, I was wondering if um you had any
[00:06:45] thoughts on how Olympia would be able to be
[00:06:51] integrating some kind of long-term incentivization mechanism.
[00:06:58] Yeah. Um it's it's a problem, I guess, for all
[00:07:04] blockchains. um it's not as much of a problem for Bitcoin because it's super
[00:07:10] it has a good price right now. But if the block reward goes down then that's what miners are at some point there has
[00:07:16] to be a point of crossover where the transaction fees are making more than the block rewards are.
[00:07:23] Mhm. I don't think we're on a path to to see that with our current volume of transactions
[00:07:29] and all these things. Uh the way to get more transactions is to have more things
[00:07:35] going on and more development and that's kind of the impetus behind Olympia is
[00:07:42] creating a a community DAO where people can make proposals and get funding and
[00:07:47] go do things like write blog articles or keep the software up to date and things like that. So the things that uh are the
[00:07:56] non-glamorous parts of blockchain and open source projects trying to fund that
[00:08:02] uh and doing it off of the transaction reward uh is the Olympia twist on it. So
[00:08:07] there were 1098 I think was the treasury proposed by IO IOHK a few years ago and
[00:08:14] that was taking from the block reward. uh and it runs into the same problem
[00:08:20] that you would have if you were that the miners will run into eventually of the block rewards go away and if there's not
[00:08:25] transactions then there's no incentive to continue development. Uh using this
[00:08:31] smoothing is a a good way of keeping the um
[00:08:37] a persistent or a constant stream of miners mining. Uh if you know
[00:08:43] that someone's made a large investment in infrastructure, they're going to keep mining. um
[00:08:50] something. And so having the smoothing reward uh is kind of a a bonus for
[00:08:57] continuing to mine ETC for the transactions cuz you get a continued reward for however many uh blocks after
[00:09:04] the reward you or the block you just mined. So it's kind of a smoothing of that um income.
[00:09:13] And so I the way that I guess that they would be combined Olympia and the smoothing would be that the for the base
[00:09:19] fee some portion of that would go towards the U Olympia
[00:09:25] uh DAO treasury contract and then the remainder would go towards the miners
[00:09:30] and then some portion would go towards the smoothing paid out over however many blocks.
[00:09:37] Mhm. Uh and I guess the the idea behind it is that the security is important
[00:09:43] right now. the block rewards paying for the security and through the um efforts of the mining pools
[00:09:51] and the development was taken care of by the uh people who were here early in
[00:09:57] Fort Code or uh just different people in the ecosystem
[00:10:03] that u as we've seen it's not a sustainable model longterm uh to hope
[00:10:10] for donations and things like that. So being able to position the ecosystem to support itself is long-term is I think
[00:10:17] the my big goal thing.
[00:10:23] I see. So the
[00:10:28] um I guess like a starting point would be a
[00:10:34] 50/50 split. I'm not I'm just pulling numbers out of the air at this point, but
[00:10:40] um would would the would there be like a
[00:10:46] a USD based target to fill up Olympia or would that just be a fixed 50%.
[00:10:53] And also the the actual transaction fees at this
[00:11:01] point are quite low. Like we're talking a yearly budget of like uh let's see I
[00:11:09] think it's about $1,000 a week is the is the average
[00:11:16] transaction fees. So on a yearly basis that would be 50k
[00:11:21] and then if it was half of that 25k. Yeah. So I'm not sure like
[00:11:26] pretty compared to block rewards right now. Uh yeah. Yeah. the transaction fees
[00:11:33] basically would I I don't know if it'd pay for a single person's salary. Yeah.
[00:11:39] Which is a problem. Uh no doubt. Uh it would definitely not pay for even a
[00:11:44] single single block to get mined either right now. Uh so it's it's a crisis of
[00:11:50] it's like a security problem that we're going to run into at some point that we can see now coming. Uh, so maybe that's
[00:11:57] a way to think about it is we know that at some point there's going to be a crossover of the block reward is less than the transactions.
[00:12:04] We want to be able to hopefully say that the transactions are going up and that's why it happened. Not because we have no
[00:12:09] transactions and the block reward went away. Yeah, I agree. And I do I'm aligned with the
[00:12:16] goal of increasing. I mean essentially it's the price of etc that's going to dictate a lot of things
[00:12:22] and also demand for the chain and those two variables um
[00:12:29] can they be shifted by the creation of a Dow is the question that's funded by 50k
[00:12:37] USD a year or was is does there need to be some other mechanism and are we potentially
[00:12:43] introducing additional complexity and focus focusing time on something that
[00:12:50] may or may not work compared to like a more simple thing that provides additional assurance and is less uh
[00:12:59] I don't know complex. Yeah, I mean it's a bootstrapping
[00:13:06] problem I think of when when do we need the money or how can we do this? Right now it is chump change more or less the
[00:13:14] what we would get on the transaction fees but also right now the co-op still has funding and the uh etc DAO also
[00:13:22] still has funding that is able to support uh until there are transactions.
[00:13:29] But that's that's the really hard part that we have to tackle next of if we do
[00:13:34] get this set up and we know that we'll have funding eventually. Someone actually has to start putting in work on this project and make this a real a real
[00:13:41] chain. I mean, we have a good narrative. It's we are the security chain. We've got good principles. It's everything is
[00:13:49] there and in place and working and running. It's no one's ever put forth that effort to make ETC the
[00:13:58] viable alternative to people of u whenever they're doing these pitches.
[00:14:04] Like there's no reason Salana should be a number three coin that gets added to banks and things like that and ETC
[00:14:10] shouldn't be in the mix too. We just haven't had the I don't know presence or something or
[00:14:16] there's we've the effort hasn't been there to move in and frustrates me
[00:14:22] still. But it's also partly my fault. I guess I can take blame for that too. I've never
[00:14:29] fully committed and leaned in. I don't think it's uh it's not something
[00:14:36] that any anyone's really to blame for. It's it's macro market realities in
[00:14:41] terms of uh this this new and emerging space. So I don't think
[00:14:47] anyone's to blame. I do not think we're in that bad a place actually uh because
[00:14:54] the fundamentals are way more important. Market cap is something that can be quite easily manipulated and is not a
[00:15:00] really good reflection of like how
[00:15:05] liquid a market is and how things are distributed fairly in terms of the number of holders. And if there's one
[00:15:12] guy with half the the market cap of a coin, then they can easily make it whatever price they want to based on the
[00:15:18] last trade. So, I actually think that ETC is probably um
[00:15:24] more valuable fundamentally than a lot of the the coins with a higher market cap because of that because it's been
[00:15:30] around for so long and because it's uh probably one of the fairest distributed chains out there. So I think looking
[00:15:38] into market cap can can maybe like seem depressing but is not actually that
[00:15:46] useful of a metric in terms of long-term success. Yeah, blame might have been the wrong
[00:15:52] word. Um I guess whenever for my day job
[00:15:57] currently I'm consulting with a bunch of uh capital markets institutions who are
[00:16:03] looking to bring uh crypto to the American financial markets.
[00:16:09] I think that's the most neutral way to explain it. Uh and at some point there's going to be a ratings agency that starts
[00:16:16] evaluating coins. And Ethereum Classic is hands down amazing uh on paper.
[00:16:22] uh it's been around the longest. It resisted change whenever there was the DAO. It uh
[00:16:28] development equivalent to Ethereum. It has proof of uh work, highly secure.
[00:16:34] Uh everything about it is amazing, but it hasn't had uh
[00:16:41] the personalities, I guess, to get it taken seriously. I guess I don't
[00:16:48] have a better way of saying it. It's not one of those Yeah. Uh
[00:16:53] there are coins that or groups, I don't even know
[00:16:59] if I'd call them coins or projects. It's communities that early on did the ICOs. They had they have a huge war chest now,
[00:17:05] hundreds of millions of dollars. And the ones that haven't already rugpulled and ended up on a beach and valley doing
[00:17:12] development for their blockchain are making the rounds right now. uh talking
[00:17:17] at the World Bank, chain links, doing things with Swift, uh the DTCC, like now
[00:17:24] is the time that everyone's been waiting for for all the blockchain and uh finance stuff. ETC's position
[00:17:30] brilliantly for it, but we're at a problem of all the money was blown on seemingly
[00:17:37] silly stuff that never mattered. And the people that are left are the ones that were volunteers who were just here for
[00:17:43] the passion of it. And now we're trying to figure out how to uh convince ourselves that we should set up funding.
[00:17:51] Yep, pretty much. To bring to bring it back to uh Olympia on that topic,
[00:17:58] is there not a risk of changing the the game slightly with
[00:18:03] regards to how like because ETC is a purely it's like one of the most decentralized coins. It's the most
[00:18:10] commodity if you're looking at security commodity spectrum. And because there's
[00:18:16] no centralization, then it's like really difficult to claim that this is like anything other than a
[00:18:22] commodity. And like looking at the Olympia proposal, I'm seeing like we're going to
[00:18:28] put like a an LLC and a some kind of company that's receiving and managing
[00:18:35] the funds. And I'm like, is that is that potentially going to open up the whole protocol to additional legal risk and
[00:18:43] kind of inheriting the properties of whoever's managing that LLC?
[00:18:49] Yeah. And that's I have no idea. I'm not a lawyer. Uh so
[00:18:55] that's definitely a lawyer question. Um I don't know. Um, at some point the
[00:19:03] wherever this money comes from or goes to needs to find a way of uh funding these things. Right now the co-op does a
[00:19:09] lot of it. It's right 40,000 a month to keep all the services online for as far as block
[00:19:16] explorers, RPC endpoints, u websites, other things, personnel. Uh,
[00:19:25] so that's it has runway. I mean it's the co-op's there. it can keep the services
[00:19:30] going for now until something else gets established. But at some point that money runs out because it's a not for
[00:19:35] profofit. There's it they can't do anything to raise money other than ask
[00:19:41] people and it doesn't have somebody out there asking people. So the other way to do it would be to have uh the Zcash
[00:19:47] model of the blockchain is able to contribute to a real person who can do
[00:19:55] this on their behalf, whatever mechanics it is that gets it in place. Uh but it the Zcash is a nonprofit or
[00:20:04] not for-profit foundation also, but they they have millions of anonymous donors because every block counts as a donor.
[00:20:11] And so that's I think I guess my thinking behind the Olympia needs a some
[00:20:17] kind of legal entity. the Dows and um the LLC dowels are the closest thing
[00:20:24] from a legal entity right now that that matches what would be on chain. But I
[00:20:29] think it's open to really anything because Olympia should be a system where coins go into a uh
[00:20:38] preunded account and then people can submit anyone can submit proposals and
[00:20:44] there's a voting process and then anyone should be able to get funds out of it. The LLC would be there for the
[00:20:50] establishing like a longerterm service contract, but it would also have to go through the same process of submitting a
[00:20:56] proposal, getting public scrutiny, and having to get approved by the U members of the DAO.
[00:21:06] So, I wouldn't say the LLC would be special in that regard. It's not like it just gets access to funding.
[00:21:13] I see. And with regards to the um the
[00:21:19] distribution of voting tokens in the DAO, has that been how would that
[00:21:25] initially be kicked off? Uh
[00:21:32] it's a good question. Um because I don't know that's another
[00:21:38] bootstrapping problem. I guess we could give it to all the coin holders, but there's no guarantee that all the coin
[00:21:44] holders exist or want to participate or are intelligent enough to make calls on
[00:21:52] technical decisions. Uh so I'm not sure I mean this would have
[00:22:00] to be definitely discussed of one way to do it would be coin voting. Everyone who has a
[00:22:06] coin does it. Another way would be to create a some kind of um NFT or voting
[00:22:13] token and distribute those in a fair way. Um but I'm not sure of a a way to
[00:22:20] do it fairly and get consensus. Yeah,
[00:22:25] I think it's one of the big problems um
[00:22:31] with because because yeah, if it's if it's just a coin vote, then obviously like
[00:22:36] uh like Wales will be able to manipulate voting and it's not it's not it's not
[00:22:42] necessarily like a a fair way, but it's the only
[00:22:47] unbiased way that doesn't require like uh some other admin system to figure out
[00:22:54] who to distribute them to. Like coin votes is the only metric as far as I know that is completely like uh
[00:23:01] objective within a a contract system to to to kick things off. I guess you could
[00:23:08] have additionally like a a registration window where people can uh use their
[00:23:14] coins to stake in order to get a token, but then you're also like leaving out the people that have their coins in cold
[00:23:20] storage and the people that like are not sure whether to use the protocol and then they're being required to do
[00:23:27] additional steps that may or may not, you know, work out.
[00:23:32] So I I do think that a lot of the the mechanisms of Olympia need to be
[00:23:38] extremely like well thought out and made explicit and
[00:23:45] it seems like a lot of them are not fully formed at this stage. Yeah, that's fair. But I mean also this
[00:23:54] is this is the group to solve that the people the people I mean another thing
[00:24:00] uh that I've seen recently uh I was listening to on a podcast is futurearchy
[00:24:06] where it's basically a prediction market where you would lock up your coins uh
[00:24:12] for the decision. So if there was a for instance if we knew that something had to get implemented to say make 1559 on
[00:24:21] the Ethereum classic blockchain uh it could go to a vote and then the people
[00:24:27] voting for it would lock up their coins because they think the price of ETC is going to go from $14 to $20. So they
[00:24:34] could essentially do a short and uh somebody else would take the opposite of action because they don't think it'll
[00:24:39] work out. And so then the prediction market is the voting mechanism of if enough people have locked up their coins
[00:24:46] and are in this boat with you then the then it passes and you can go um and if
[00:24:52] it doesn't then the change never gets implemented. So that would be an interesting way to do it. But
[00:25:00] I don't know. It's some how do how do we figure out what the best way is to do
[00:25:06] this as a group?
[00:25:12] Well, I I reckon my suggestion would be to like do an implementation first and
[00:25:19] see if there's something that might work and do that on like a test net or even
[00:25:26] mainet just with small amounts. But until there is a
[00:25:32] viable DAO setup, it seems like it's kind of getting ahead of ourselves to
[00:25:38] say like like this major update is planned for 2026.
[00:25:44] Well, I think I'll uh I can chime in. I I just joined the call. How's it going, guys? Um
[00:25:50] hi, Chris. Good. Thank you. So, it sounds like you're talking about uh ECIP 1113.
[00:25:58] Um, and I I think that uh I noticed a lot of
[00:26:03] kind of how you you've been framing things is that everything's set in stone and very uh detailed. Um, the thing
[00:26:12] about uh 1113 is that it's more of a framework. Um, so if you read the
[00:26:19] proposal, it's it's it's not set in stone and extremely detailed because
[00:26:25] there's many options for many uh applications of
[00:26:31] this type of treasury. Um, for instance, uh, it includes the option for child
[00:26:38] Dows. um where I think one of the concerns that was brought up was you know what
[00:26:44] about uh you know the client maintenance right uh typically client maintenance
[00:26:50] isn't very controversial um do you need a robust
[00:26:56] token weighted coin voting system uh just to have transparent proposals
[00:27:05] saying hey we'd like to keep EVM compatibility ility. Um, I don't really
[00:27:11] think that you need that. And there's an option, you know, to build a child DAO
[00:27:18] uh system that allows transparent proposals, allows transparent funding
[00:27:27] um, requests for that. I think that these are things that we don't have in
[00:27:33] client maintenance right now. Um and then uh and then you can buy a
[00:27:38] system or you can build a system that's uh very streamlined to that. Um one that
[00:27:45] doesn't require massive uh you know community consensus around everything
[00:27:51] because we generally operate under the framework that Ethereum Classic is going
[00:27:56] to maintain EVM compatibility. Um, so I'm ju I'm just trying to highlight that
[00:28:02] Olympia as I think Cody has mentioned numerous times um in writing and uh and
[00:28:09] on the previous call is that Olympia is more of a framework to get the changes
[00:28:16] that are generally required to maintain EVM compatibility. as an example, type
[00:28:21] two transactions uh are becoming required in wallet systems, which wallet systems
[00:28:30] to uh to someone that is maybe an end user, they just think, oh, MetaMask,
[00:28:36] right? Um no, wallet systems are like Fireblocks and um exchange ecosystems.
[00:28:44] So to make sure that etc maintains support you know and availability to the
[00:28:50] global world you need to make sure that these type of transactions are supported.
[00:28:55] So I'm just trying to highlight cover we covered the 1559 stuff at the start
[00:29:01] and got we basic we basically agreed that we do need to do this a 1559 style
[00:29:07] thing and we're now discussing like the four options. So, we have Olympia, smoothing over blocks, a reservoir
[00:29:13] system, or a hybrid approach. And we're getting into the Olympia part because
[00:29:19] it's one of many different options. And the we we just like kind of need to get into
[00:29:25] the details of how it's actually implemented because if it's possible, then we can do it. But if it's if it's
[00:29:32] like impossible to do it in a fair way, if there's not one like reasonable
[00:29:38] approach, then it can't really be one of the options. So is is there like one
[00:29:46] one way of doing the fair distribution?
[00:29:51] Are you saying for a DAO system? I think I think it's written right now
[00:29:58] uh it's written as a one address one vote and then um it mentions that there
[00:30:04] are many options uh that provide civil resistance and things like that but you
[00:30:13] know it's written in a way where you can set this up and then you can start
[00:30:18] adding proposals to modify um for whatever use case you need right
[00:30:26] for the treasury and um and that's how it's written right now because there are
[00:30:32] many many treasury systems that exist right now and as Cody was just highlighting of
[00:30:39] we have to decide how we want those funds to be allocated and and sliced up
[00:30:47] um and the voting systems that we want around the different use cases for those
[00:30:52] funds. Additionally, as I think you have highlighted is um you know the type 2
[00:30:59] transaction fee market starts at 0. So it's not um something that needs to
[00:31:06] be resolved to you know tomorrow, right? This is not this is not something that
[00:31:11] needs to be rushed. Olympia is designed in a way that is modular and you
[00:31:19] effectively can do ECIP 1111 which is the feed redirect which is what you are
[00:31:27] talking about right you are talking about the Olympia framework and implementing it you're saying that it's
[00:31:33] different with an L curve or something like that but those are just very min minor knobs that we get to tweak and
[00:31:40] adjust in this phrase framework. So, um we can do 111 very easily and then
[00:31:49] is Olympia is Olympia a treasury proposal or is it
[00:31:54] something else? Cuz to in all the marketing and the announcements it like
[00:32:00] Olympia equals a treasury. Olympia. Olympia has an element in there
[00:32:06] which is 1113 which is what do you do with the base fees which the base fees are not like
[00:32:15] claimed by the miners which is what some people have tried to claim is that the miners have the rights to that. They do
[00:32:22] not. Um and it's when these fe what happens with
[00:32:28] these fees? I believe you were proposing to burn them. Um, and then I believe
[00:32:33] you've changed you've changed your position on that. And so it's what do you do with these
[00:32:38] fees that adds values? And at the time, you you've been absent for about a year, but at the time,
[00:32:46] you know, ETC Co-op was signaling that they were going to be
[00:32:53] um reducing their core team and they were running out of runway.
[00:33:00] And what happened was in it might have been October and then it executed in
[00:33:08] December of 2024. Bob Summerwell laid off two, you know, reduced his staff um
[00:33:16] after a heavy a heavy payroll burn and then the documents came out that kind of
[00:33:22] showed where all of those funds were going and the the Treasury idea came out
[00:33:29] of, okay, so we've been talking about this since the last time that Bob Summerwell said that they were going to
[00:33:35] go under, which was me and you on calls in 2021 or 2022 talking about setting up
[00:33:43] some long-term Treasury proposal, right? And so, so this this is not an idea that
[00:33:50] um came out of nowhere. This is like 10 years of conversation that has resulted in this. Cody in 2021 was suggesting,
[00:33:58] hey, maybe we should use this base fee um towards a treasury. And I think at
[00:34:04] the time in 2021, the idea was, okay, well, let's observe that and see what
[00:34:09] happens. And we've seen that happen all over the EVM space, people all over the
[00:34:15] EVM space are using contracts that are doing this um and and solving these type of issues,
[00:34:20] which are called public good issues, right? So it's been something these other projects conversation
[00:34:26] they're not comparable because the other projects they don't have the same requirements in terms of neutrality and
[00:34:32] equal footing of the protocol and unless there's a way to actually implement this
[00:34:38] they do they certainly many do and how can you say that over all of the EVM you
[00:34:43] could say some EVMs are have a centralized team and things like that give me an example
[00:34:50] yeah they're they're built into the ECIP key. There's plenty of examples in there.
[00:34:57] What's an example of a a treasury system that has
[00:35:03] equally equal neutrality and equal footing requirements that ETC has?
[00:35:09] Well, for one, I I think you need to frame it as right now, are we operating
[00:35:14] under a decentralized model in our core or in our uh in our client maintenance
[00:35:21] at all? Ato like is is it not entirely centralized right now?
[00:35:28] It's 100% centralized. Is the protocol centralized? is is the work that uh decides what the
[00:35:36] protocol is is that centralized. Yes. So that's working on getting more
[00:35:41] decentralized. Um Bitmain will be bringing on developers as well. So the development work is getting spread out
[00:35:47] some. Um the question is can you implement this? Can you change the protocol in a way
[00:35:54] that implements this treasury whilst maintaining neutrality and equal footing? And I don't think it's
[00:35:59] possible.
[00:36:11] Like so far the only thing that's been actually proposed is a a coin vote.
[00:36:17] It's that's actually not true at all. And that's what I'm saying where I don't believe that you're given uh a fair a
[00:36:24] fair assessment of the ECIPs uh the coin. You just you just said in this conversation that to begin with we just
[00:36:31] have a coin vote. No, I said it's explicitly does not do a coin vote
[00:36:37] because we know uh that was the IOHK model that um that required coins and
[00:36:44] staking if you remember all of that. It does not do that. It's a one address, one vote. And then you have civil
[00:36:50] resistant systems that you can implement with that because obviously it would be very easy to uh fire up a ton of um you
[00:36:59] know single addresses and vote in however you wanted. So um so it's not uh it's not a a coin
[00:37:07] vote, which is what you keep framing it as. And it says that right there in the proposal,
[00:37:13] but it also says and it suggests many many options. Explain the the mechanism,
[00:37:19] right? I I've I just have like you've said it's civil resistant,
[00:37:25] but how is it civil resistant? No, no, no. I'm saying and then you can implement civil resistant systems which
[00:37:30] it lists here. Sorry, I have to find the um
[00:37:37] on this call though at least. Can we take what's that? I don't I don't know if we're gonna solve it on this call, but can we
[00:37:43] No, of course. Of course not. And it's it's Can we do this as a takeaway? Can in two
[00:37:48] weeks from now, can we meet back and talk about three different options? That way we can at least have something more
[00:37:54] concrete that we can at least compare and contrast
[00:37:59] because I think right now it's it's abstract. From a technical level, yes, we could easily put this into the 1559
[00:38:05] any of the systems. It's a variable, but the actual implementation I think is
[00:38:10] still open because we don't have a solid these are the next five steps that we
[00:38:16] would do if we decided for this or this is the model that we would use. So maybe getting clarity on what the actual model
[00:38:21] is that we can debate between that then is the next step. Yeah, that that sounds like a great ne
[00:38:29] next steps. I mean we've come I think in this conversation we've come a long way. A few weeks ago, people didn't even
[00:38:35] understand that EIP1559 was necessary for this network, you
[00:38:41] know, and now um people also didn't understand that uh using type 2
[00:38:46] transactions were optional, right? You still get to use type one transactions
[00:38:52] if you wanted to. Um so, so I think there's there's been a great educational
[00:38:58] onboarding happen happening. um the fact that if we want to start getting into
[00:39:03] the 1113 mechanics, which um which it,
[00:39:08] you know, it sounds like we're still ironing out the 1111 mechanics uh of
[00:39:14] in my opinion like 1113 should come first.
[00:39:22] Like we can't really decide how we're going to implement different earlier
[00:39:28] options unless we have a natural solution that can work for 1113
[00:39:38] cuz they depend on each other. Well, it's module. So, and 1113 what's
[00:39:45] beautiful about the that framework is that 1113. So it's actually 1111 is
[00:39:51] essentially the type two transactions and the redirect 1112 is the immutable
[00:39:58] contract of the treasury itself which are bulletproof. I mean these are contracts
[00:40:03] that are tried and tested throughout the EVM space. And then 1113 is not client
[00:40:08] work. 1113 is uh a module DAO framework
[00:40:13] that can evolve to the network's needs as time goes on. The beautiful that
[00:40:18] the beautiful let's say that 113 let's say that 13 is not possible for some reason because I
[00:40:24] mean right now we don't know whether it is unless you can actually provide some proof that there is a possibility and if
[00:40:30] it's not possible then there is plenty of EBMs you keep saying there's no proof there's plenty this is
[00:40:36] all built on best practices but those other projects are not decentralized they're not Ethereum
[00:40:42] classic and there's no way of implementing this bootstrapping mechanism in a fair your your alternative is entirely centralized. Try
[00:40:50] to think about that. This is patching an entirely centralized
[00:40:56] operation right now that is critical to the network. Try to zoom out and think about that. It is 100% centralized
[00:41:04] around if right now if Diego wants to do client maintenance, you need to think about
[00:41:11] that. So, you know, Diego is not that these conversations of funding public
[00:41:17] public goods in a decentralized way are not new. There is so much material on this. So, I it's just to say we don't
[00:41:26] even know if someone has done this or anything. There is so much material.
[00:41:31] It's as Cody said is that you're talking about variables that can be adjusted and
[00:41:36] modified, but it's not it's not framed as oh my gosh, this has never been
[00:41:41] thought of before. There are so many attempts and so much so much stuff to work with. So
[00:41:47] provide one example a a productive way is to at least look at it that way. Um, in terms and
[00:41:54] additionally as you're doing with things like the L L curve smoothing and things
[00:41:59] like that, you're you're opening your mind in that realm, you need to also open your mind in the 1113 side as well.
[00:42:06] There's tons of material to read. Provide one example then of a system
[00:42:11] that works in a decentralized way that you can bootstrap such a an important and currently completely decentralized
[00:42:17] protocol from, right? And the and the ECIP has many examples in there. Bright ID, Gitcoin,
[00:42:25] Gitcoin Passport, Proof of Humanity. There's so many options here. As Cody
[00:42:30] was saying is that there's many options here and there's going to be there's going to be
[00:42:36] so many options now that we're ready to have that conversation. We'll have to be sorting through the options. So a as we
[00:42:43] can pick up on another call if you want a very detailed call on all of these type of options that are listed there we
[00:42:49] can start going through them. It's an extremely important aspect of whether or not this whole thing can be
[00:42:55] implemented or not. And you're saying oh yeah we're there's so many we're for sure that one of them is going to be
[00:43:00] fine but until we've actually validated that one of them can work with etc. It seems like we're getting ahead of
[00:43:06] ourselves. We're not because the conversation is evolving right now. just two weeks ago
[00:43:12] you didn't believe that uh 1559 should exist and you were sending me DMs saying
[00:43:17] that you were going to fight it to the end and now you are on board with 1559. So that's the process of
[00:43:24] of you going through consensus, right? And so so you're catching up on a conversation and and we understand that
[00:43:31] we wrote we wrote this. We've done a ton of research on it. So the conversation is evolving there. So if we're going to
[00:43:37] evolve into okay, we're happy with 1111 and we're happy with 1112, then we can
[00:43:44] start talking about 1113 as well. And that's fine, just as Cody Cody agreed with. But just understand that you like
[00:43:52] you are coming along with the Olympia framework because you're seeing all of
[00:43:57] the detail and the technical merit that is going on and how it is adding value
[00:44:02] to the ETC ecosystem. This is designed to fix a huge problem that we were
[00:44:07] facing just in December and it's a problem that we faced numerous times in the past. So I'm just trying to
[00:44:14] highlight the bigger picture here that this is not extreme. This is not rushed.
[00:44:19] This is 10 years in the making.
[00:44:25] Very passionate about it. Um, so I guess we're almost at time here.
[00:44:33] Um, I think helpful for next time would be a blog post with options that we can
[00:44:39] discuss, two or three of them. Uh, I'll talk with Diego on looking at the 1559
[00:44:45] work. So we it sounds like it in some implementation or another it's coming. So we need to start looking at how we'll
[00:44:51] get a test net stood up for it from I guess just the tactical things that we can do while we're working on the social
[00:44:58] consensus for how or if the governance will come into
[00:45:03] play. So Chris, if you can put together a blog
[00:45:08] post with three or four options that we can talk through next time, I think that
[00:45:14] would be helpful. And then the story, if we could do this again in two weeks, would that Well, let
[00:45:21] me see if America can do it in two weeks. Yeah, we're still good. 3 weeks is Thanksgiving. Uh
[00:45:28] yeah. Yeah, I was I was thinking about that. So, but I think these are useful. I mean,
[00:45:33] I mean, there's still things that I'd like to talk about if if you don't mind if you have time. I got to drop in four minutes. The I
[00:45:41] mean, yes, definitely stay on. Keep talking. still still I mean Diego still brought up the idea of whether we want
[00:45:46] to do it in two forks or one fork and currently I mean I don't know what
[00:45:53] Olympia's proposing but it seems like multiple forks and I think like people have different
[00:45:58] opinions on how we should do this and it really matters like getting the whole package we can't just say oh let's
[00:46:04] create this address and dump things there and maybe we'll use it in the future if this future voting system
[00:46:09] works we need to really figure things out before we start proposing that, oh yeah, we're going to do this hard fork
[00:46:15] next year cuz that's that's like it, right? I I would just say that uh I
[00:46:21] think uh 1111 and 1112 are the client work. The other stuff is outside of the
[00:46:27] client. So in terms of when you're thinking about a hard fork, you're essentially it's the redirect and the
[00:46:33] address are the address or the L uh curve smoothing are kind of the hard
[00:46:40] fork client upgrade elements and then the 113 and 1114 are are outside of
[00:46:49] client hard fork requirements. Also, if Cody has to hop off, um I don't
[00:46:56] know if you guys for housekeeping stuff, if you guys had talked about the Discord update or any of those things. Um how
[00:47:03] how is how is that going? And then um and and just uh um these car calls are
[00:47:11] helpful, so it's good that you're coming back and and hosting these again. So, thank you.
[00:47:18] Yeah. Uh I guess we can wrap things up now. Um, thank you for joining. I'm
[00:47:24] hoping that we can continue the discussion and I will continue doing the
[00:47:29] call. Uh, with regards to Discord, I I did not mention it yet.
[00:47:36] If you if you'd like to feel free to to talk about that now, I think we're going to update the
[00:47:42] the Ethereum Classic website to change the default Discord server to a new server.
[00:47:51] Right. Right. So, I thought maybe you guys had talked about that before I joined. Um, just cuz Cody had mentioned
[00:47:57] that you guys would talk about it on the call. So, uh, anyways, it's just a PR and it's just changing the highlighted
[00:48:02] links to a maintained server. Um, that would, you know, we'll have active
[00:48:08] maintainers. Uh, we'll have elevated roles to be able to maintain the server.
[00:48:14] Uh, hopefully spread it out. The current server uh is uh owned by a single person
[00:48:20] named Mo. Um Mo has just been absent. Although, you know, I just saw him post
[00:48:26] something or do something uh re recently, but he's generally been absent
[00:48:32] for um at least since 2023. Yeah. And the the current server is
[00:48:38] basically overrun with bots and it's difficult to maintain discussion. So, Right. And so so the only goal is to
[00:48:45] just put uh productive conversations in a place that has automated uh p purging
[00:48:52] of scammers and and and spam and things like that. And so it's just building a professional uh setting for chatting. Um
[00:49:01] the other legacy Discord is still listed on the website right next to it. Right now both this Discord is listed. It's
[00:49:08] just it's the old one is the highlighted one and we're just changing it so that the highlight on the website takes
[00:49:14] people to the new maintained one. Um, I think that it's about time now because I
[00:49:20] believe there's only one person that is maintaining the old server and uh just
[00:49:25] moderating the old server and that's just Jin and uh and it's just you know this the poor guy he comes in every
[00:49:32] single day and it's you know hund you know not hundreds but tens of scams
[00:49:37] every single morning on the on the server. So yeah, and hopefully this also opens the
[00:49:43] door to like more integrations and automations that were not possible on the old server because they require
[00:49:49] admin access and things like events being listed and that kind of stuff. So nice things to have and it's a fresh
[00:49:56] start and all that. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I think that uh that's a great point of now with so many
[00:50:01] new tooling uh and like um all of these LLM agents and everything is that that
[00:50:07] we can add automation and so much. So hopefully hopefully that's the goal and
[00:50:13] uh and it'd be great if etc had a lot more automation in its pipelines so that
[00:50:19] you know our small little group of contributors um can use their time wisely.
[00:50:25] Yeah. Um, I did want to mention as you're on the call that one of the things that
[00:50:33] I was kind of sort of
[00:50:40] unsettled by was the the framing of Olympia in in its
[00:50:45] announcements and the kind of the idea that this is a settled thing and that
[00:50:51] it's going to happen next year and it made it seem like it reaching consensus where it maybe didn't
[00:50:58] necessarily have it. And I understand that I wasn't here for the whole of earlier this year,
[00:51:05] but you know, plenty of people have made their voices heard, and I don't think it really had the level of consensus that
[00:51:12] it seemed to be claiming to have on the um on the announcements that have been made
[00:51:18] on various Ethereum or officialish looking things. So, I just wanted to flag that and that was the main thing
[00:51:23] that I was like what's happening here.
[00:51:29] Right. So, um I I think you were you've been absent. Um and then I believe
[00:51:35] you're referencing maybe is it two or three more people that have uh been
[00:51:41] vocal with you that didn't understand 1559, didn't understand its optin, uh
[00:51:47] that it's an add an additive transaction type. I mean, these are non-technical people that have opinions that generally
[00:51:55] their opinions were reviewed and and they weren't even technically accurate.
[00:52:00] Um, of I believe it was, like I said, it was maybe four of you guys. Um, but
[00:52:06] there was a call about this. Um, it was held on Discord. Uh, and then that had
[00:52:12] issues and then it migrated to Twitter. Um and that was kind of an initial
[00:52:19] temperature check on you know what became Olympia. Um so there there's been
[00:52:25] discussion on this. You've been as I said you've been away. Um additionally the Olympia framework has had you know
[00:52:33] over 300,000 views generally most sentiment is generally positive
[00:52:39] uh and neutral to positive. And then and then you came in you came in and uh you
[00:52:46] came in and sent me some DMs saying, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're trying to hijack the network essentially." And
[00:52:51] it's like, "My man, where have you been?" You know, uh what are you doing? I've been in the I've been the ECIP
[00:52:58] discussion thread and the only response is a negative. Like, no, it's just it's just you and Zang.
[00:53:03] It's just you and Zang. Me and Zang and uh Diego, there've been people that have been proposing
[00:53:09] different things. this Diego is not not negative. In fact, Diego is working within the Olympia
[00:53:14] framework. So, I'm not sure, but but anyways, Atora and then and then I think
[00:53:20] you sent you sent me a threat saying I needed to withdraw to save face. I mean
[00:53:26] there's plenty of plenty of things that you've done um in the you know since you've came back that are a little hairy
[00:53:33] but uh but you know if if your thing is that I was gone and and the network you
[00:53:40] know started moving through something that's been talked about for about 10 years now um you know building some sort
[00:53:48] of way to fund the critical public goods of this network. It's been something
[00:53:54] since etc dev, right? The multi-IG address was set up specifically to do this and they talked
[00:54:00] about building an entire onchain voting system to distribute funds, you know.
[00:54:05] So, this is something that since 20 uh 2016 has been a topic and what what we
[00:54:12] were facing when you were absent was we were facing two of the core developers
[00:54:17] had just been fired. Um the executive director left. Uh Donald McIntyre was
[00:54:26] writing that they're running out of funds and it's going to be up to someone else to handle the maintenance of the
[00:54:31] network. Uh and it's no longer their priority. It's in in one of his blog posts.
[00:54:37] And so so that was the climate that was the climate that was happening prior to you could have reached consensus.
[00:54:43] There's no like in in less than a year and you don't even know what the mechanisms are going to be yet for this
[00:54:48] proposal as we've discussed on this call but you're talking about fine fine t
[00:54:56] fine details but but you're you already are on consensus that 1559 needs to be
[00:55:02] implemented right you're already on consensus with that see you've already moved to the
[00:55:08] consensus so so I'm just I'm just trying to say like like you're frame ing of that. Oh,
[00:55:14] I didn't know about it, so consensus wasn't formed isn't accurate. There's been there's been talk about 1559 and
[00:55:21] doing implementing a redirect and things like this and then long-term funding. Uh we understand that type two transactions
[00:55:28] will generate zero dollars on the day that they're implemented because you have to opt into them, right? And so
[00:55:35] you're talking about many things down the road, but you're generally starting to come down the path of consensus
[00:55:42] there. And you and the alternative the alternative of people that I think it's
[00:55:47] just been you and Donald are the two that vocal people. Donald is totally for
[00:55:52] oifying which is deprecating the network. These aren't you know these aren't realistic conversations to have.
[00:55:59] We're not going to oify if how do you maintain EVM compatibility and oify you. It's it's an oxymoral
[00:56:06] changing the subject. I'm I'm saying that you should not have announced that Olympia a treasury is happening next year. That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:14] F if you're following the conversation, we're already starting to talk about the implementations of a treasury right now.
[00:56:21] I understand that you might have a hard position where you are against any sort
[00:56:28] of treasuries, but I'm letting you know right now that the fact that we're talking about it right now and on these
[00:56:34] calls and that we're talking about implementmentation, this is this is the the final stuff of
[00:56:41] consensus, right, of the final implementation stuff. We're already kind of aligned with this general framework.
[00:56:49] it's already it's already kind of the ethos and so, you know, I appreciate
[00:56:54] that you are, you know, doing the due diligence and all of this. It would have
[00:56:59] been great if you were here a year ago, um, when conversations and ideas were getting kicked around. Um, but anyways,
[00:57:08] you know, and and you were here in 2021 and 2022 when like this base fee
[00:57:14] redirection was talked about. So, you know, I was also there when we both rejected a
[00:57:19] pro protocol layer treasury, Ethereum classic. No, we didn't. We rejected a centralized
[00:57:24] hard-coded team. Uh, it's a protocol layer treasury. That's the issue.
[00:57:30] We rejected a we rejected IOHK's hard- coding 20% debt uh minor tax,
[00:57:36] you know, things like that. It's and that's and if if you're going to frame any Olympia in any sort of way as
[00:57:43] comparable to IOHK's proposal, I mean, these are just drastically different worlds with
[00:57:50] drastically different approaches. Um, you know, no one's trying to uh hijack
[00:57:56] the the coin reward, right? The block reward. No one's doing that, right? It's
[00:58:02] it's a whole system built on type two transactions.
[00:58:08] aligning everyone around a robust fee market, which is good for everyone.
[00:58:13] That's literally the what this entire system is designed about is how do we
[00:58:19] build a robust fee market so as block rewards go off, miners continue to have incentives, right, to secure the
[00:58:25] network. Um, so so it's just drastically different. So, it's it's difficult to
[00:58:31] when you're phrasing it in this way that paints anyone that's trying to solve problems as,
[00:58:37] you know, having some uh negative connation to their actions.
[00:58:44] It's difficult, especially when you weren't even present. Um, I've already explained the reason
[00:58:49] and now and now you've and now you've positioned yourself as the sole person that gets to decide
[00:58:55] if consensus was formed or not. I'm saying if there's major push back, then you can't claim that consensus
[00:59:01] exists. There isn't major push back, there's you and Donald. So, are you claiming that consensus over
[00:59:08] this does exist? I'm claiming that I'm claiming that it's very apparent that uh there appears
[00:59:16] consensus for this. I I think that I think that even you are coming to consensus, but you may not realize it
[00:59:22] right now. And that's fine. You know, just to be clear, your position is that we already have consensus on Olympia
[00:59:29] implementing the Treasury and you were correct to announce it that it's happening next year. That's your position right now.
[00:59:36] If that's what you believe, if that's what you believe that that's what those articles stated, you know, if that's if
[00:59:42] that's how you feel. Um, but I think it's important for you to for you to
[00:59:48] realize that you don't get to hijack the network and oh, it's whatever you say, right? You
[00:59:55] are not solving problems. You're not solving any problems. You haven't proposed any ECIP.
[01:00:02] You haven't done anything. You just you just realized that and so so that is what it is. Um, this
[01:00:12] is the only logical path forward that has been proposed.
[01:00:17] This is the only logical ECIP 1000 compliant path that is there.
[01:00:24] If if we already have consensus, why are we even discussing it currently? If if you're not realizing
[01:00:31] with the calls is that we're actually talking about implementation details right now. Uh, for instance, the
[01:00:36] follow-up call to this is now we're moving on to talking about like Cody is
[01:00:42] talking with Diego about implementing the 1111 redirect and then and then you
[01:00:48] know the details of the little uh variables in there are what's left to be
[01:00:54] decided in that. Now, uh 1112 is generally bulletproof because
[01:01:00] it's just a contract and you know it's using open-source contracts that are are
[01:01:05] heavily audited audited. So there's not a lot of discussion there. Now we're moving into the details of 1113. Right?
[01:01:13] So I don't know what you think is happening but these are conversations
[01:01:18] about implementation of these elements that were drafted and are the only ECIPs
[01:01:24] about the future of Ethereum Classic. The alternative that which has been proposed is to oify and do nothing. That
[01:01:31] is not what's happening here. So I don't I don't know how you want to frame that
[01:01:37] in your mind, but I'm ju I'm just trying to my observation is that these are the these are the things that are happening
[01:01:43] right before us.
[01:01:53] So Olympia is happening next year. I guess we'll see what uh what when a
[01:02:00] final block is is decided and everything but as you can see is that you are literally talking about the
[01:02:06] implementation of Olympia right now. You're talking about the past two calls
[01:02:12] that is what you're talking about. So I was talking about the implementation of something like 1559
[01:02:19] right which is part of Olympia which is which is the 11-11. They're different
[01:02:25] things though. Olympia Olympia is a treasury proposal.
[01:02:32] If that's what's if that's what you believe, Olympia is a framework. That's that's
[01:02:37] I mean that's that's what implementing 1559 and and deciding what to do with it.
[01:02:45] So I mean in in all the announcements about Olympia, the main thing is that it's a treasury. So I don't know how you
[01:02:52] untangle those two concepts. Well, it's it's modular, so it's it's good to
[01:02:59] understand that there's four ECIPs, and so you're working through the elements of them right now.
[01:03:05] They depend on each other, though, so they're not completely independent modules,
[01:03:12] right? 11 as I stated earlier 111 and 1112 are the client work and then 13 is
[01:03:18] the modular DAO treasury governance work
[01:03:25] and then 1114 is the proposal framework.
[01:03:32] So okay 13 doesn't work then 12 doesn't work and if 12 doesn't work then
[01:03:39] like maybe 11-11 is implemented in a different way in a completely different ECIP. So to say that we're already
[01:03:47] talking about implementing Olympia I think is disingenuous like we haven't decided. I think you're framing as a bit
[01:03:53] disingenuous because you're not acknowledging that you are doing that. You're literally talking about I think
[01:03:59] the last call was the L curve smoothing which I think is a good idea, but it's just a minor adjustment of as Cody said
[01:04:07] on the call was I mean you're talking about like the percentages of the redirect and I think that adding
[01:04:14] long-term minor uh benefits and helping our security budget um through the L
[01:04:20] curve is a good idea. It's something that wasn't on my radar and I and I'm happy that that came up through I
[01:04:27] believe it was Diego and uh and the beautiful thing is that you know through these conversations we're since we're
[01:04:33] talking about very minor things it's very easy to update the ECIPs to reflect that. Um and that's and the
[01:04:40] implementation details are kind of going on right now that are are ironing those things out. So I mean that's the reality
[01:04:48] that we're in right now is that that is down the line. Sure. What if down the line it turns out
[01:04:54] that a treasury is not something that works out and instead it's only an L smooth mechanism or something else like
[01:05:00] that? Is it still I believe that I believe that that would be a percentage thing, right? That would
[01:05:07] be deciding a percentage of the L curve smoothing. What if it's zero?
[01:05:12] But but then but then you'll have to you'll have to talk about how you decentrally fund client maintenance
[01:05:20] and things like that. How do you support everything? Because right now, I think your proposal was to just have Bitman
[01:05:25] pay for everything. I don't believe I have a proposal
[01:05:30] currently. I'm just saying Bitcoin. I thought that I thought that your in
[01:05:36] our chats, I thought that your suggestion was that um that Wales or
[01:05:41] Bitmain or something like that would just pay for everything like we've been having.
[01:05:46] um you know the model that keeps failing every 2 to 3 years.
[01:05:53] I'm saying we should emulate Bitcoin and other decentralized chains.
[01:05:59] Does Bitcoin have the maintenance requirements as Ethereum Classic?
[01:06:09] I don't think that's really the limiting factor for Bitcoin. I think there's plenty of uh research and funding going
[01:06:16] on regardless. And actually like the
[01:06:24] the things that you're talking about funding with the meager amounts that you'll get from the transaction fees,
[01:06:31] they're also not going to fund enough.
[01:06:37] Right? That's true. If you believe that we will not have a transaction fee market. But if that's the case, then we
[01:06:43] also won't have any network security because the block rewards are going off. So you understand that if you say that
[01:06:50] there will be no transaction fees, then you're also saying that there will be no hash rate to secure the network. So
[01:06:57] these are the type of conversations that it's important to it's important to tether to reality
[01:07:03] and and and try to build the the proper incentives, you know, into the system um to be self-
[01:07:12] sustaining in the long term and have a long-term viewpoint opposed to who's going to pay for stuff today and it's
[01:07:19] not my problem, but someone else should put the money and and um I'm going to tell them how to spend their money,
[01:07:26] right? And so, you know, the current the current approach of Donald, for
[01:07:31] instance, who was receiving $144,000 of those funds a year and then was let go
[01:07:39] um to write blog post articles. Donald, you know, his approach is, well, there
[01:07:45] should just be a centralized organization that controls all of development on Ethereum Classic. And you
[01:07:51] know, I I don't think that many people would agree that that's a decentralized
[01:07:57] and in the ethos of Ethereum Classics. So, you know, hopefully we can we can take this opportunity to solve those
[01:08:03] type of things in the long term. Um there will be stop gaps that are required. Um, right now I think Bitmain
[01:08:10] is hiring as as Cody mentioned is hiring two core developers to try to
[01:08:18] fill the stop gap while it's necessary. But to say that there's not going to be any transaction fees in the future is,
[01:08:25] you know, is a pretty bleak outlook for Ethereum Classic, I would say, is sort. So anyways, I'm happy I'm happy to chat
[01:08:32] with you offline since it's just me and you talking. Um, we can have our differences, but but what's nice to see
[01:08:39] is that it seems like at least the few accounts that had opposition to 1559,
[01:08:47] even if they technically didn't understand that it's entirely additive and optin and and legacy transactions
[01:08:54] still exist, the legacy free market still exists, all of those things. um
[01:08:59] those accounts are starting to move over to where I it's hard for me not to say
[01:09:05] that you know we're on an inevitable path here. So happy to continue to join
[01:09:12] the calls and I'll be prepared with you know a few examples of 1113 frameworks
[01:09:18] that we can start considering for you know the initial implementation
[01:09:24] conversations. Okay,
[01:09:31] sounds good. I would just hope that we can be uh realistic about the the status
[01:09:37] of this thing and that
[01:09:45] the inevitability that you're claiming doesn't really serve to actually make it
[01:09:51] more inevitable. You can't manifest this just by saying it. So, it's going to be a long process and there's a lot of
[01:09:58] details to work out and it might not work is all I'm saying. So, let's see.
[01:10:04] Right. Ato. And I just I just want to mention that Cody, myself, you know,
[01:10:10] Diego, people that are working on solving these problems and maintaining EVM compatibility are showing up and
[01:10:18] doing the work. And so, you're right. if someone just tried to do a change and
[01:10:24] didn't and didn't uh didn't follow through at all or didn't, you know, adjust and think and
[01:10:31] you know, creatively solve the problems. Um I think that would be the case, but that's not what anyone's observing here.
[01:10:37] So, um we're we're seeing problem solving happening in Ethereum Classic. Um and it's great. It's a great thing.
[01:10:44] So I I hope that you know you'll continue to engage in good faith and uh
[01:10:50] and I think I think that Ethereum Classic in the end of at the end of this
[01:10:55] will come out very strong uh and in a better position than it was uh when the
[01:11:03] core team was deprecated uh after the spiral update you know in 2024. So, um,
[01:11:09] that's the goal, you know, and it's it's following the ECIP 1000 process to do so.
[01:11:18] Okay, cool. Well, uh, that's a good place, I think, to ask for any final comments. I know we have some other
[01:11:24] people in the chat room. Did anyone want to jump in before we wrap things up and say say your piece if you have any?
[01:11:34] I can still see a uh a familiar
[01:11:40] familiar handle. Is that Brolo?
[01:11:47] Hello, guys. Can you hear me? Hey, Brolo. Long time no speak. How's it going?
[01:11:53] I'm good. How are you? Uh just dropping by to say hi. And uh I'm glad to see
[01:12:01] that uh people are taking a closer look to to Chris proposals.
[01:12:10] Um, one thing that I wanted to say is that and I said it uh I think some
[01:12:17] months ago it's also about the legitimacy the
[01:12:24] the proposers are having in the sense that it's also
[01:12:29] somehow political. I think that uh a path forward is to to keep core core
[01:12:38] development in the US area. I think this should be also
[01:12:46] uh something to think about and uh
[01:12:51] even if it's under uh LLC, right? It
[01:12:56] also gives some sort of legitimacy and accountability about what would be the
[01:13:04] path forward. As for the voting system, well, I already criticize that
[01:13:13] it's complicated, but solutions should be should be seen. Uh,
[01:13:20] it was nice hearing you on.
[01:13:27] Thanks for joining, Br and thanks for the comments. Yeah, I think the the LLC
[01:13:32] is one of the question marks of the proposal and we didn't get much time to talk about that one, but uh
[01:13:40] yeah, I'm happy to I'm happy to drop just like a quick note on that LLC and and the concept of that which you know
[01:13:47] is derived from I believe a community call 11 or 12 back in 2021 2022 between
[01:13:54] me and you. uh and it was it's just generally um in the United States at
[01:14:00] that time there was a new entity uh that was brought in in Wyoming was the state
[01:14:10] and what it enables us to do is it enables us to legally hold anyone that
[01:14:16] has to do fund any sort of fund uh handling outside of the network. it it
[01:14:24] allows us legal recourse for uh against them if they were to do something that
[01:14:30] was not desired by the Treasury DAO system. And so I don't know if that
[01:14:36] exists in a different country. Um but it's it's a legal framework that those
[01:14:44] people just remember that the 1112 contract is non-custodial and immutable.
[01:14:51] So the LLC doesn't actually hold any funds or maintain any funds. This is essentially an edge case where if
[01:14:58] someone doesn't want to receive payment in ETC on the ETC network and they want
[01:15:03] fiat payments and they want tax forms from a US tax entity um for their 1099
[01:15:12] work uh which is contract work. Um, this is an entity that would be able to take
[01:15:19] the funds, convert them essentially into US dollars, and then pay that contractor
[01:15:25] and then issue them a tax form. And so that is kind of the edge case that's
[01:15:31] going on with that. And so, um, you know, it's been twisted and confused a
[01:15:37] little bit where some people believe that that LLC would be the controller of the funds. the ECIP explicitly states
[01:15:45] that they have no control over those funds. The onchain process would essentially instead of paying the
[01:15:51] contractor directly would pay the LLC which would convert it to US dollars and then pay them. So it's just it's just a
[01:15:59] way it's it's called a it's like a legal rapper is I think how uh people call them these days. But it's a way to work
[01:16:06] within the fiat framework and in the hiring process that some
[01:16:12] companies may have where they do not accept onchain payments. And so um so
[01:16:18] anyway, so that's generally what's happening there. And then if you read about it, um the operating agreement,
[01:16:25] you know, you set an operating agreement, you set a a contract that's on chain um and that's all registered
[01:16:31] with the state. you know, I if there was any actions that were against what the
[01:16:37] DAO did uh or or had voted on, then um
[01:16:43] you'd be able to file a lawsuit against the person that was handling the money and did the actions that uh weren't
[01:16:50] voted on, right? So, that's kind of it's it's a legal protection framework. How how does the protocol elect who
[01:16:58] controls the LLC? uh the protocol does not it that that
[01:17:05] could probably be something that was done within the proposal framework and so that would be you know what 114
[01:17:15] how how do we reflect the wishes of stakeholders? How do we determine what people want to do with regards to who
[01:17:23] gets to control the LLC? How do we uh can you can you rephrase
[01:17:30] what do you mean by that question? Uh so ETC stakeholders, miners,
[01:17:36] developers, people that hold the token, how do they
[01:17:42] how how how in a decentralized way does the decision become made of who gets to
[01:17:47] control the LLC and how how can their wishes be accurately reflected,
[01:17:55] right? And so so again this would just be through the the standard proposal process right
[01:18:01] which comes later in 114 right right which relies on 113
[01:18:08] well 113 is the uh onchain mechanisms
[01:18:14] right the 114 is the offchain like
[01:18:19] process similar to how the ECIP has a process how we have the ECI IP 1000, right?
[01:18:26] So, so how do how do you reflect the wishes of ETC stakeholders in deciding the LLC owner
[01:18:35] specifically? I I'm I guess I'm a bit confused on
[01:18:42] what's the issue with the LLC owner. Wouldn't Wouldn't you just be able to put a proposal for that?
[01:18:50] Sure, you can put a proposal, but how do you vote on the proposal? who gets to vote,
[01:18:56] right? And and this is this is the this is what you just asked about of the
[01:19:01] entire 113 framework about 15 or 30 minutes ago,
[01:19:06] right? You're asking for specific on how you want the DAO to be managed. But what I'm saying is they're all inter
[01:19:13] open, right? Like 112 depends 112 depends on 114 depends on 113. And if you can't do 112,
[01:19:21] then like they Why can't you do 112? Because you need to elect the LLC.
[01:19:29] Why do you need uh why why I mean it's part of the proposal. 112
[01:19:35] includes uh the LLC, right, for fiat interfacing?
[01:19:41] No, it doesn't. I'm reading I'm reading 112 right now. 112 is the onchain treasury contract.
[01:19:49] And there's a paragraph right here that says offchain fear interfacing and administration execution will be
[01:19:54] performed by Ethereum Classic Dow LLC. That's part of 112, right? That it's
[01:20:01] it's the ownership of and the proposals and and what you're talking about is not
[01:20:08] part of one two. The treasury contract is one
[01:20:13] two. the mention of the LLC is that's continuity between the other ones, but
[01:20:20] it's not defined there. It's not a blocker in in any sort of client work at
[01:20:26] all because as I just mentioned, the LLC has no control over the treasury contract.
[01:20:35] that the LLC is only there to just as if you submitted a proposal and you were
[01:20:40] successful in a proposal, funds would be released to your address. The same is
[01:20:46] true with the LLC of funds would be released to the LLC. Granted, it would
[01:20:52] be released in the in a way where they are now required to do some sort of actions which is like pay a contractor
[01:20:58] in fiat um for work for winning a proposal. So,
[01:21:05] Mhm. the LLC itself does not control the immutable treasury contract. I think
[01:21:11] that that's maybe where the confusion is coming from. I'm not saying they're controlling it.
[01:21:18] Um, but they are defined in 112,
[01:21:23] right? They're mentioned in 112. You're right. Yeah, they're mentioned. Okay.
[01:21:28] It's true.
[01:21:35] So to go through the step-by-step process of how this LLC is elected,
[01:21:42] there'd be some kind of onchain vote. There'll be a proposal then a vote for that.
[01:21:50] So So I think what I'm looking up your reference here and it says maybe we
[01:21:55] should just read it. says, "Offchain fiat interfacing and administrative execution where required shall be per
[01:22:02] performed by the Ethereum Classic DAO LLC, a legal registered entity that operates
[01:22:08] strictly under binding instructions from the Olympia DAO governance." That would be 1113 with no discretionary authority.
[01:22:17] Right? And so again, this is just a legal rapper where um it just it's
[01:22:23] essentially what you see with etc co-op how they take um Grayscale's money and
[01:22:30] then they hold it and then they're paying out developers. It's a way to do that type of off-chain fiat interfacing.
[01:22:38] Uh but it's legally bound to whatever the DAO decides on chain because of the
[01:22:43] Wyoming DAO LLC framework. So you said before that we're already
[01:22:50] talking about we basically decided that we've implemented 112 but this is like a treasury contract
[01:22:56] right? Yeah. Well this is an example of a treasury contract. I believe you said
[01:23:02] you said that uh we needed to have treasury contracts in there and so we've we've added an example of that.
[01:23:11] Sorry I said that you need a treasury contract. No. One of your feedbacks in July was
[01:23:16] that you wanted more details and so are you mentioning that are you looking at the create to address deviation? What
[01:23:23] what are you referencing out of 1112?
[01:23:29] Yeah. So 1112 is the Olympia Treasury. Right. Right. And what element are you asking about in
[01:23:37] there? How is this treasury contract becoming
[01:23:46] immutable after deployment? It it says it shall
[01:23:52] remain remote immutable with no proxy patterns, upgrade hooks or other owner privileges. So when this thing is
[01:23:59] defined, how is it upgraded to 113?
[01:24:07] Right? So I believe the the treasury contract itself is deployed and then that does
[01:24:14] not change and it's the address of the deployer
[01:24:20] um well I I guess the DAO framework uh
[01:24:25] my understanding the DAO framework has
[01:24:31] the Dow Sorry.
[01:24:56] Okay. So the specifications, the Olympia Treasury contract shall be
[01:25:03] deployed at a fixed deterministic address. This address shall be hardcoded into Ethereum Classics consensus logic
[01:25:10] as defined in 1111 as the canalogical recipient of the base fee. Right? And
[01:25:18] then
[01:25:25] in 11 month three it says the treasury shall remain immutable with no proxy patterns, upgrade hooks or owner
[01:25:31] privileges.
[01:25:40] Because if it has the ability to be upgraded at this point, then the question is who gets to do that?
[01:25:59] right? So you're asking how the DAO upgrades. So this is 1113 and states
[01:26:05] upgra upgradable governance logic. Governments models may be upgraded via
[01:26:11] onchain proposal subject to quorum threshold and time lock. The treasury contract shall remain permanently
[01:26:18] immutable. Yeah. No admin privileges, no centralized
[01:26:24] entity shall hold override powers or be able to execute treasury dispersements outside of the DAO process, right? And
[01:26:32] so you're asking me how the Dow process works and you know what we're talking
[01:26:37] I'm asking how the treasury goes from like in your proposal you're modu you're
[01:26:43] modularly deploying this stuff. So you have 1112 which is the the treasury first and that's immutable. You can't
[01:26:49] change it. But then later on comes the DAO or some other contract system.
[01:26:55] How does the Treasury get told that now the Dow's in charge? Who gets to control
[01:27:00] that?
[01:27:59] So I think maybe you're asking about the execution logic that's laid out here in
[01:28:05] 1113. Where am I looking?
[01:28:15] Oh, no. This is about proposals. I'm talking about the Treasury contract.
[01:29:43] would you prefer to go into detail on the next call?
[01:29:49] I mean, sure. Yeah, it's probably I think you're asking me uh uh a question that's probably better suited for Cody
[01:29:56] in terms of that the implementation of it, but H okay.
[01:30:01] I'd guess that I'd guess that it's it's probably um written in there. I just I I
[01:30:06] don't have it right here.
[01:30:12] Okay.
[01:30:18] And again, what was your question? It was how how how is the immutable treasury
[01:30:25] contract updated to be informed of which
[01:30:31] voting token Dow or whatever system, governance system you want to put in there is in control of it.
[01:30:42] If it's done in a modular Okay.
[01:31:28] I guess I can add this to a topic for next week, next uh next month.
[01:31:34] Yeah, I think Yeah, I think uh it sounds like getting into 1113 stuff uh would be
[01:31:41] great for the next call. Just to be clear, this is uh 1112, I
[01:31:47] believe, the Treasury contract, right? But it's it's related to changes
[01:31:52] when you change the 1113, right?
[01:31:58] Well, I'd assume that if it's immutable, there'd need to be a built-in mechanism to upgrade and that would be part of 1112.
[01:32:06] Unless you're talking about doing a hard fork and then it's not really immutable, right? I think there's I'm I'm finding
[01:32:13] the section right here. I think it says governance integration. So, I think we'll pick up on that. That
[01:32:19] sounds great. Like great topics for the next call. Sounds good.
[01:32:25] Well, thank you for your time and I'm glad we can have these discussions once
[01:32:30] again. It's been a while. I do apologize for not being present all the time, but sometimes,
[01:32:35] you know, you got to make uh you got to balance your life out. But I'm back. So, um, I'll continue in
[01:32:43] the calls. Sounds great. Good to have you back.
[01:32:49] Same thing going on over here. That's why I missed your last call. Cheers, Chris. See you next month.
[01:32:56] Byebye.
