# AI Generated Summary

## Key takeaways

- The group discussed implementing an EIP-1559-like mechanism for Ethereum Classic to maintain compatibility with upstream Ethereum
- Four options were considered: smoothing over blocks, Olympia treasury system, reservoir system, and hybrid approaches
- There was agreement on the need for 1559-style transactions, but disagreement on whether to implement a treasury system
- Transaction fees are important for long-term miner incentives as block rewards decrease
- The current ETC ecosystem faces funding challenges for maintenance and development
- Tensions emerged between Chris and Istora regarding consensus and implementation details of the Olympia proposal
## Brainstorm topics

### EIP-1559 Implementation Options

Istora: Introduced the four main options for implementing a 1559-like mechanism in ETC
- **Details**
    - Istora: We need 1559 for compatibility and interoperability with upstream Ethereum
    - Istora: We can't copy Ethereum exactly because they burn transaction fees, which would affect ETC's emission schedule
    - Istora: Transaction fees will be important for incentivizing mining in the future as block rewards decrease
    - Cody: It's a problem for all blockchains - at some point transaction fees need to make more than block rewards
- **Options Discussed**
    - Smoothing over blocks: Distributing transaction fees over multiple blocks
    - Olympia: A treasury system for funding development and maintenance
    - Reservoir system: An idea proposed by Istora since the last call
    - Hybrid approach: Combining different mechanisms together
### Olympia Treasury System

Cody: Explained the Olympia proposal as a way to create sustainable funding for ecosystem development
- **Details**
    - Cody: Olympia would create a community DAO where people can make proposals and get funding
    - Cody: The base fee would partially go to the Olympia DAO treasury contract, with the remainder to miners
    - Chris: Olympia is a framework with multiple ECIPs (1111, 1112, 1113, 1114)
    - Chris: ECIP-1111 handles Type 2 transactions and fee redirect, 1112 is the immutable treasury contract, 1113 is the DAO framework
    - Istora: Questioned how the treasury would be governed and whether it could be implemented fairly
    - Chris: The proposal includes options like one-address-one-vote with Sybil resistance mechanisms
- **Concerns**
    - Istora: Worried about centralization and changing ETC's commodity-like properties
    - Istora: Questioned how voting tokens would be distributed fairly
    - Istora: Concerned about the LLC structure mentioned in the proposal
    - Chris: Explained the LLC would only handle fiat conversions when needed, not control funds
### Transaction Fee Economics

Cody: Discussed the importance of transaction fees for long-term sustainability
- **Details**
    - Cody: Current transaction fees are very low (about $1,000/week or $50K/year)
    - Istora: At current rates, transaction fees wouldn't even pay for a single person's salary
    - Cody: We need to increase transactions and demand for the chain
    - Istora: Shared a visualization showing block rewards decreasing over time
- **Future Considerations**
    - Cody: At some point there will be a crossover where block rewards are less than transaction fees
    - Cody: We want transactions to increase before block rewards decrease too much
    - Chris: Type 2 transactions will generate $0 on implementation day because they're opt-in
### ETC Ecosystem Funding and Development

Cody: Discussed current funding challenges and potential solutions
- **Details**
    - Cody: The ETC Co-op currently spends about $40,000/month on services and personnel
    - Chris: The Co-op reduced staff in December 2024 after heavy payroll burn
    - Cody: ETC has good fundamentals but lacks marketing presence compared to other projects
    - Istora: ETC is probably more valuable fundamentally than many higher market cap coins due to fair distribution
- **Funding Models**
    - Chris: Current client maintenance is centralized and needs sustainable funding
    - Istora: Suggested following Bitcoin's model for funding development
    - Chris: Bitcoin has different maintenance requirements than ETC
### Discord Server Update

Chris: Mentioned updating the official Discord server
- **Details**
    - Chris: The current server is owned by an absent person named Miko and is overrun with bots
    - Istora: The plan is to update the Ethereum Classic website to change the default Discord server to a new one
    - Chris: The new server will have active maintainers and better moderation
    - Istora: The new server will allow for more integrations and automations
