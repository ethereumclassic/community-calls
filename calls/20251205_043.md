# AI Summary

## Key takeaways

- The meeting focused on discussing two competing proposals for implementing EIP1559-compatible mechanisms in Ethereum Classic
- Olympia proposal (ECIPs 1111-1115) would redirect base fees to a treasury system with on-chain governance
- ECIP 1120 proposes an algorithmic return of fees to miners over multiple blocks
- Concerns were raised about Olympia's governance system lacking specific details
- Participants expressed concerns about Olympia being marketed as a done deal before consensus
- Previous treasury proposals have been rejected by the ETC community
- Questions about governance, representation, and implementation details remain unanswered
## Brainstorm topics

### EIP1559 Implementation Options for Ethereum Classic

Istora: Summarized the current proposals for implementing EIP1559-compatible mechanisms
- **Details**
    - Istora: Olympia (ECIPs 1111-1115) proposes redirecting base fees to a treasury with on-chain voting
    - Istora: ECIP 1120 (authored by Istora and Diego) proposes returning all fees to miners with an algorithmic mechanism
    - Istora: On Ethereum, base fees are burned, but this would affect ETC's emission curve
    - Wedergarten: Expressed concerns about Olympia effectively implementing a tax on transactions
- **Conclusion**
    - Two main approaches are being considered: treasury system (Olympia) vs. algorithmic return to miners (ECIP 1120)
    - Both aim to implement Type 2 transactions for better user experience
### Olympia Governance System Concerns

Wedergarten: Raised concerns about the centralized nature of pooling funds and the lack of specificity in governance
- **Details**
    - Wedergarten: "There's a lot of possibilities... but it's quite unspecified and still very up for debate"
    - Wedergarten: Governance options could include giving power to all ETC holders or to miners
    - Istora: Raised concerns about how to bootstrap the original governance system
    - Istora: "Are given this ability to vote on proposals and importantly, upgrade the DAO code itself"
    - Istora: Warned about potential scenario where a handful of people could take control of the DAO
    - Justjin: Expressed concern about how the ECIP is being handled, appearing forced rather than discussed
- **Conclusion**
    - Governance system details are critical but currently insufficient
    - Risk of centralization if governance system is not properly designed
    - Need for more specific proposals on how governance would work
### Free Market vs. Treasury Approach

Wedergarten: Advocated for free market principles over a protocol-level treasury
- **Details**
    - Wedergarten: "I believe in the free market and in free market principles"
    - Wedergarten: If there's demand for protocol changes, the free market will find the most efficient solution
    - Wedergarten: Users expect transaction fees to go directly to miners for security
    - Istora: Noted that $10 million in ETC from Bitmain is already available in a multi-sig contract
    - Istora: Suggested proving DAO concepts work before integrating them into the protocol
    - Wedergarten: Anyone can build a treasury system using smart contracts without protocol changes
- **Conclusion**
    - Treasury proposals have been rejected in the past by the ETC community
    - Free market solutions could be tested before protocol-level implementation
    - Concerns about deviating from ETC's original principles
### ECIP 1120 Technical Details

Istora: Explained the technical approach of ECIP 1120 for returning fees to miners
- **Details**
    - Istora: Uses a "backwards-looking stateless fee distribution" mechanism
    - Istora: Base fees would be split over approximately 50 blocks and distributed to future miners
    - Istora: Implementation already exists in VESSU client
    - Istora: Research questions remain about linear distribution vs. decay curve
    - Wedergarten: Asked about the technical specifications compared to Olympia
- **Conclusion**
    - ECIP 1120 aims for minimal complexity while supporting Type 2 transactions
    - Technical implementation is more defined than Olympia's governance system
    - Research tasks are ongoing to finalize specific parameters
### ECIP Process and Client Implementation

Wedergarten: Asked about the ECIP process and how changes get implemented
- **Details**
    - Istora: Explained ECIP stages: Work in Progress → Draft → Final Call → Accepted → Implemented
    - Istora: ECIP 1120 is currently blocked from being published as Work in Progress
    - Istora: Miners ultimately have veto power by choosing whether to upgrade clients
    - Wedergarten: Asked about repository access and who controls client implementations
    - Istora: Explained separation between ETC GitHub organization and ETCLabs Core repository
    - Istora: Emphasized importance of rough consensus to prevent chain splits
- **Conclusion**
    - ECIP process requires rough consensus to move forward
    - Checks and balances exist through distributed repository ownership
    - Chain takeover would be difficult due to open source nature of clients
### AI Development in ETC

Istora: Mentioned AI-assisted development happening in the ETC ecosystem
- **Details**
    - Istora: Cody Burns is using AI to build a Scala-based Ethereum Classic client
    - Istora: AI tools like Claude Code can help with development tasks
    - Justjin: Expressed interest in the AI development approach
    - Istora: AI tools give hope for projects with fewer developers
- **Conclusion**
    - AI development tools could benefit ETC by reducing developer requirements
    - New client development is progressing with AI assistance
