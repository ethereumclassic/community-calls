[00:00:00] Hey, so hello and welcome to Ethereum Classic community call number 44. Today is Friday, December 19th, 2025. This community call is an open voice chat discussion about Ethereum Classic. Everyone is welcome. Please be excellent to each other. The call will be published on YouTube, and if you're interested, you can join the call, uh, one hour before in the green room. This is a pre-call hangout that will not be recorded. You can find us in the Discord voice channels.

[00:00:27] This week we have an announcement to make, which is a new community calls website, which you can find at cc.ethereumclassic.org. On this website you can browse all the past episodes. You can trans—you can subscribe to the calendar or RSS feed to never miss a call. It has a time, it has a time zone converter so you can, uh, ensure that you're arriving at the right time, and you can find AI summaries of all the calls, and there'll be more features to come.

[00:00:54] So, uh, without further ado, let's dive in. Um, there are three topics. Oh, I see Diego has his hand up. Would you like to chat or was that just a, uh, a clap?

[00:01:07] Yeah, no, it was just a clap for your great work on the website.

[00:01:12] Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Diego. Yeah. Um, it was made with the help of Claude Code CLI. So, I'd like to thank all the, uh, all the LLM producers out there that helped. Um, so there's three topics that we can dive into today, and there's no particular order, but basically they are: we have, uh, basically an approval deadlock on some, uh, merges happening on the various Ethereum Classic repos that we could dive into and try and sort out while we're on this call. There's some remaining questions about Olympia that were brought up in the last call that I was hoping if, um, some of the authors might be able to address this this call. And then finally, some potential, uh, discussion about editorial guidelines about ethereumclassic.org and this new Ethereum Classic community website.

[00:02:13] Is there anyone, uh, on the call that would like to jump in on any other topic or any particular topic that I've brought up?

[00:02:28] Okay. So, in that case, I think we should just jump into the first approval deadlock issue. And I'm referring particularly to a comment made by Cody about trying to sort out this merge for ECIP 1120, which was authored by me and Diego and submitted for a pull request on the ECIPs repo about two weeks ago and has since been basically in approval purgatory for the last two weeks, trying to appease one of the, uh, ECIP maintainers. And it seems, Cody, that this is okay with you. Um, do you have any ideas on what we can do in terms of next steps to get this merged?

[00:03:20] Yeah, I think for next steps, uh, updating the editors in the ECIP repos is probably the next step. I mean, the process is intended to get as much information out in front of people as possible so they can read and think and debate about it. I mean, filibustering it doesn't really help anyone. So, uh, and we don't—I think Meow Bits is still the other maintainer or editor, whatever the role is, in the ECIP, so we need to refresh those anyway.

[00:03:58] Okay. I saw that you, um, recently made a pull request to update that list of editors, and, uh, I approved and merged that one. So this would be rotating the inactive editors. This is PR 549, and I think you switched Meow Bits out and added Diego to the list of maintainers. Is that something that's been reflected in the, uh, the teams now as well, or is that just on the ECIP?

[00:04:29] It's a good question. Let me check.

[00:04:41] Will, would you mind, uh, sharing the link to this PR in the chat?

[00:04:47] Yep, no problem. I'll send it through in just a sec. I got it. I'm sending it.

[00:04:53] Thank you.

[00:05:09] Oh, no. I meant, uh, the other one, the one adding me as an editor, or the other one that you were just mentioning.

[00:05:22] Let's see.

[00:05:29] All right. I will share that in just a second.

[00:05:37] It's number 549.

[00:05:40] Sorry, 549.

[00:05:43] And I'll paste this in the chat.

[00:05:48] Okay. Do you see that?

[00:05:52] Yeah. Thank you.

[00:06:00] Yeah. So just for the record, I want to make sure I'm not going insane and that my interpretation of the ECIP categorization is indeed, like, correct in that, like, Standards Track / Core is appropriate for ECIP 1120, as far as I can tell.

[00:06:27] Right.

[00:06:34] Yeah, I agree with that.

[00:06:37] Cool.

[00:06:39] I think if we have, like, majority support to merge this, then I—and there's no—I mean, Chris has been invited to the call, and I was hoping he'd join to, um, to get his interpretation, um, analyzed, I guess. But, uh, he's not here at the moment. But I think, like, with three out of four of the maintainers supporting this, we can go ahead and merge it at this stage, even if it means, uh, dismissing the stale review.

[00:07:16] If anyone is against that, then please let me know.

[00:07:28] Okay. So I think that 1120 can go ahead and be merged. There's also, um, a kind of side issue with the ECIP WIP status, work-in-progress status, which in ECIP 1000 is listed as, like, optional.

[00:07:51] So any ECIP that is going to be updated in the future could be, like, early stage listed as work in progress. And it seems that, uh, Chris was suggesting to use this status at some point for 1120, and I was okay with that. But it seems like there's an ECIP validator, um, Ruby gem, which is an external dependency on the ECIPs repo. It's maintained by Meow Bits, and it doesn't support WIP.

[00:08:20] So any status of WIP was just failing the build, and for that reason it was causing a bit of confusion.

[00:08:27] I have another open pull request that changes the logic so that it's no longer depending on an external gem, and it's running that validation locally within the ECIP repo.

[00:08:43] So that's another, um, pull request that I would request review from maintainers.

[00:08:49] So this would allow us to manage all the validation locally without relying on that outdated, um, Ruby gem in the external library.

[00:08:58] Makes sense. What's the difference in work in progress and draft? Is draft more complete than work in progress?

[00:09:07] Yeah. So the only mention of WIP in ECIP 1000 is that draft ECIPs may be in very early stage, may be entered as WIP, which means they're a work in progress. That's the only thing that it mentioned.

[00:09:25] So it’s probably the case that the WIP as a status wasn't part of the original assumption, and then this WIP clause got added in at some point but didn't update the validator.

[00:09:38] And the workaround so far has just been to prefix everything with WIP in the title.

[00:09:45] So—

[00:09:48] That's one option, but I think it would be nicer to just actually have a WIP status.

[00:09:53] Yeah, having it internal and being able to control it is definitely the preferred, I think.

[00:09:59] Yep. So that pull request I made, I'm not a Ruby guy, and it's co-authored by AI agents. It seems to work, and I've tested it, but if someone is familiar with Ruby and can sanity-check this, it seems to be fine. But it would be nice if someone could do that before we merge it.

[00:10:30] Cool.

[00:10:33] Diego has also—you should have an invite now for the ECIP editors team.

[00:10:40] Thank you.

[00:10:47] Cool. So,

[00:10:51] yeah. And if Diego, you could approve 1120, that would also—

[00:10:56] for the record—help.

[00:10:58] I will reference this conversation for merging. Um,

[00:11:04] but yeah, that would be—that would be useful to have on the, uh, the repo itself.

[00:11:10] Yeah. Um, are you going to change the status to work in progress, or will we keep it in draft?

[00:11:19] This links nicely with the next item on the agenda, which is—

[00:11:25] um, I also made a pull request to fix the Olympia ECIPs categorization, and this brings those Olympia ECIPs in line with the same, uh, interpretation, i.e., Standards Track / Core, because they do implement, um, hard forks.

[00:11:45] So I was assuming that, like, these are not really meta ECIPs because they're going to be changing the protocol. So, and they currently are using the WIP prefix as a workaround, um, adding to Olympia.

[00:12:01] So, I understand it's a bit cheeky, but I wanted to kind of align both 1120 and Olympia in what I believe to be similar statuses, given the fact that in 1120 the, like, the parameters that are unfinalized are also unfinalized in Olympia in 1111.

[00:12:26] So I feel like they're kind of—they both require the same levels of additional research, and if one is WIP then so should the other probably.

[00:12:38] So I'm fine with either WIP or draft. Um,

[00:12:45] to be honest, I think because these parameters—like, there's no significant change to either of these ECIPs other than finalizing those parameters based on client testing.

[00:12:57] So I don't necessarily think they need to be WIP because they're not going to change too much. So I'm happy having both of these as draft.

[00:13:06] Um, but I do think the Standards Track should be updated—sorry, the type should be updated to Standards Track on Olympia, at least for 1111 and 1112.

[00:13:18] So I'm happy to update my branch to remove the WIP and merge both as draft, but I'm open.

[00:13:28] I don't have any objection to it.

[00:13:32] Cool. In that case, I'll remove the WIP prefix from the fixed Olympia ECIPs categorization PR.

[00:13:38] And I think then that the current 1120 can be merged as-is as a draft.

[00:13:56] Uh, what about 1121? I submitted a PR for that one too. This is, uh, kind of the omnibus of everything that we've missed as well along the way.

[00:14:06] Yeah, this was also in the agenda.

[00:14:11] I—so—

[00:14:16] whatever the next branch, whatever the next, uh, hard fork is called, I'm totally fine with whatever we come up with.

[00:14:23] My only concern is that Olympia has already kind of been promoted as this treasury.

[00:14:28] So I just wanted to be extra careful about how it's interpreted by people outside the ECIP process.

[00:14:36] And if we're adamant that Olympia is the next name, I'm totally fine with going with it.

[00:14:43] I just—I think it's really important that, like, the distinction is made between Olympia the treasury and Olympia the hard fork that might have other ECIPs as part of it.

[00:14:55] And that was the only thing that I think we need to, like, discuss and properly signal to people outside the ECIP process because I know a lot of people in the Discord are like “no Olympia” because they think Olympia is a treasury.

[00:15:13] So that was my only concern with listing everything under Olympia.

[00:15:16] Yeah, it's a—

[00:15:17] Yeah,

[00:15:18] fair. Go ahead, Diego.

[00:15:21] Yeah. No, sorry. Uh yeah, about that. I also think—I agree with Istora here, because if you search for Olympia or Ethereum Classic in any search engine, it will come up with this treasury thing, because there has been already, like, pretty—like—articles published on CoinMarketCap under the Ethereum Classic user.

[00:15:49] So they're pinging Olympia to be the next hard fork, um, with the treasury and all that. So yeah, I think it will be better. I don't know if we have to decide for a name right now, but if—yeah—if the next, uh, hard fork is—I mean—it's not going to include the treasury, I will keep it with a different name.

[00:16:12] Okay, I like the Olympia name because it's out there and it's been there for a year. Uh, whether or not it has a treasury in it or how the 1559 gets implemented, we—we can still decide.

[00:16:23] But just as a name, it doesn't matter to me at all because it doesn't impact anything. But this is already out there as the next hard fork.

[00:16:31] So it's easier to say Olympia is the hard fork and push articles out saying—or clarifying—that a treasury is an option in it, kind of like how the Merge did for a while.

[00:16:45] It's a long-term goal, but it can be part of the Olympia or the next fork. But, uh, the important thing is that we can agree what's in the next fork.

[00:16:54] Everyone can know that it exists and it's coming, and we can start coordinating and locking on a name and not going around in circles on it is more important to me than other stuff, I guess.

[00:17:12] I just want to call it Olympia, and then we can start bickering about what's inside of it.

[00:17:21] Yeah, to be honest, I mean, if that's a way forward, then I'm open to it.

[00:17:31] It would have been nice if this conversation was had in the first place before these promotions were made about Olympia containing a treasury.

[00:17:36] And it does tie nicely into the next topic, which is about the publication guidelines on ethereumclassic.org and having this disclaimer about the contents of Olympia and/or, like, the path forward with 1559.

[00:17:57] And the issue is that the way that Olympia has been framed so far is that this is a hard fork that's going to happen and it's going to have a treasury.

[00:18:08] So undoing that messaging—probably there's not that many people following anyway—so it's not going to be, like, a game-over scenario, to be honest.

[00:18:17] So if this is ground that needs to be ceded, then okay, I'm willing to do that.

[00:18:22] I think from my side at least we can come up with some kind of, uh, path forward on that as long as we properly make it clear that it's not necessarily—treasury things are still being debated.

[00:18:36] Mm-hmm.

[00:18:39] Okay.

[00:18:39] Yeah. Diego just—Diego just posted a link in the chat. I'll also add this to the show notes.

[00:18:45] And yeah, this is—this is, like, kind of the difficulty in using the word Olympia.

[00:19:01] But again, um—

[00:19:03] like to me this is not, like, a major blocker right now. Like, it's not really something we should be arguing about at this stage.

[00:19:12] Ideally, we should be arguing about what we're actually going to be implementing as opposed to the name.

[00:19:18] Exactly. Yeah. So maybe this Olympia developer series expands out to 1120 as well because that's the other—

[00:19:25] I mean, alternative that is out there of either way, I think we've decided we want to do 1559.

[00:19:32] We want to do smoothing. It's coming at some point. Whether or not there's a treasury portion or not is currently debated, but—

[00:19:41] Yep. More broadly—

[00:19:43] just for the—

[00:19:44] yeah, go ahead.

[00:19:45] Sorry, I was just going to mention that smoothing can be implemented in a number of ways, right?

[00:19:51] And 1115 is currently, like, a smart-contract, application-layer-based smoothing system.

[00:19:57] And it's a very different implementation to 1120.

[00:20:05] So they—they kind of are still opposing, even though there is a smoothing mechanism proposed.

[00:20:09] They're—they're very different implementations.

[00:20:22] How are they different again? Sorry.

[00:20:25] So in 1115 the L smoothing mechanism is basically—it's been defined, as far as I understand, as kind of part of the Olympia governance voting system.

[00:20:36] Each—I mean—it's kind of underdefined, to be honest, because you'd assume there needs to be some kind of transaction initiated every block to reimburse miners.

[00:20:46] But right now it's implemented as a smart-contract-based, future-looking refund mechanism in the application layer, since all of the base fee is added to that treasury smart contract.

[00:21:11] Whereas in 1120 it's based on a protocol-layer mechanism with no smart contracts.

[00:21:14] It's returned using a stateless, backwards-looking mechanism.

[00:21:19] Got it.

[00:21:23] And it—yeah. So it completely separates the application layer from the protocol.

[00:21:29] Yeah.

[00:21:30] Is part of the block of paying the previous miners?

[00:21:33] Correct.

[00:21:38] Yes.

[00:21:40] Okay. Uh, I guess in that definition then, uh, I guess for clarity—

[00:21:47] in my head, 1115 is the middle ground between the two.

[00:21:54] 1111 was all of the base fee goes to treasury.

[00:21:57] 1120 is there's smoothing—uh—all the miners get the base fee smoothed out.

[00:22:04] And 1115 is the middle of there's smoothing with a portion that goes to the treasury.

[00:22:13] Okay. And currently, do you advocate one implementation over the other?

[00:22:18] Like, currently 1115 says it should be implemented in a contract,

[00:22:25] but it could—it could be possible to implement as, like, a protocol layer and then 5% goes to a treasury contract, for example.

[00:22:33] Yeah. Protocol level would be the preference, uh, with the optional treasury.

[00:22:39] Okay. I think in that case then 1115 should be updated.

[00:22:44] Yeah.

[00:22:48] Okay. But—but in any case, both 1115, 1111, and 1120 require additional, like, uh, client testing and modeling, I think, to finalize those specific parameters, like the block elasticity and the shape of the curve.

[00:23:12] Yeah.

[00:23:14] And those are probably—the—those three are going to require the work for the next hard fork.

[00:23:18] The other ones I think are already implemented in Besu and Core-Geth, so it's just picking a block number, really.

[00:23:25] Uh, and then we magically get upgrades.

[00:23:31] Yeah.

[00:23:34] Um, so yeah, the only other thing that I wanted to highlight about the Olympia umbrella is that I think this would also need sign-off from Chris Mercer, who's the author of the original Olympia series, of whether 1120 is—

[00:23:52] and given that he's the main author, like, he should probably have some say in that.

[00:23:56] So I've left that as an open question for him.

[00:24:01] Sure.

[00:24:06] Can we talk timelines, I guess, as well on this call?

[00:24:10] Yeah, we can. I think—I think the next important thing to try and figure out is, like,

[00:24:18] how do we reach consensus?

[00:24:22] Like, how do we get input from other stakeholders?

[00:24:29] Because right now there's—there's basically two editors that support either side.

[00:24:34] There's kind of a deadlock, right? And it's 50/50, um, more or less.

[00:24:41] So how do we get other people's voices in?

[00:24:45] And how do we either allow them to signal their support for one side or the other,

[00:24:49] or, like, can we build some kind of way for miners to show what they're likely to mine in the future?

[00:24:58] Is this already built into the protocol?

[00:25:01] Is there some mechanism that we can utilize that's been used in other chains for helping us figure out where people are thinking?

[00:25:08] And are there any other ways we can think of to help us make this decision given that there is no clear consensus right now between the ECIP maintainers of which path to go forward with?

[00:25:29] Because, like, when we're talking timelines, then really I guess the implementation is not that much of a burden.

[00:25:36] It's really just, like, the coordinating and reaching consensus part that's going to take some time.

[00:25:42] And if there's any way we can shorten that time frame, then we can accelerate the fork deadline.

[00:25:50] Yeah. Well, I mean, the only, I guess, controversial part is around 1559 and its handling.

[00:25:56] The rest of it, I don't think there's any objections.

[00:26:03] So figuring out how to settle that part quickly would be really helpful, because the other stuff we could, in theory, June is possible for getting it live on mainnet.

[00:26:12] March could be—we could go live on testnet.

[00:26:17] So it's just block numbers. It's easy.

[00:26:20] But getting the consensus around 1559 is still the more challenging part, as you said.

[00:26:27] Uh, we do kind of have miner signaling.

[00:26:30] They can change the—uh—

[00:26:32] what they're using for nonce or, uh, how they're signing things.

[00:26:40] I mean, there's also, uh,

[00:26:47] a possibility of doing something like a prediction market, where we create two coins—a pro coin and an against coin—for the treasury.

[00:26:56] And people lock their tokens into it, and then we ride through the fork and then unlock on the other side.

[00:27:03] If you went with the—you didn't want the treasury, then that's the chain you're on.

[00:27:06] If, uh—

[00:27:08] Mm-hmm. You wanted the treasury, then that's the chain you're on, and both sides end up on the other one, uh, with your money.

[00:27:18] And I guess, theoretically, you sell the losing token, or the winners get the losing tokens, or however prediction markets work.

[00:27:26] I see. So you're saying that, like, uh, assuming there's, like, a chain split—

[00:27:33] or is that just—

[00:27:34] It's a—well, it's a skin-in-the-game thing.

[00:27:36] It costs people on Discord nothing to talk all day and say how terrible everything is and never develop anything.

[00:27:42] Uh, that's easy.

[00:27:48] Actually putting—uh—locking coins up and saying, “I believe in this so much that I'm willing to burn all of my ETC,” uh, is a different question.

[00:27:57] Because you have to ride out the uncertainty in pricing and, uh, all kinds of things.

[00:28:02] It changes the dynamic of it a bit.

[00:28:08] It does. Um, but at the same time, you don't want to have too much of a burden for people so that, like, you're encouraging everyone with minimal effort to engage with it somehow.

[00:28:16] Like, um, another idea would be—

[00:28:24] I'm not sure if this would work, but, like, creating some kind of relationship with the gas limit that miners can vote on, with an outcome to signal whether they prefer one or the other.

[00:28:37] Like, let's say you have 8 million—

[00:28:43] uh, 100 is a signal for yes, and then 7 million 999,999—

[00:28:53] 100 would be a signal for no.

[00:28:55] And then you can just kind of, like, vote with the gas limit target.

[00:28:58] Is that something that might work?

[00:29:01] And I'm just thinking out loud here.

[00:29:05] Yeah, I think the mining pools control that, though, because, uh, they're the ones that actually submit the blocks with the coinbase.

[00:29:13] And so I think that they control that.

[00:29:16] I don't know if individual miners can set their own gas limits as they're doing the—

[00:29:21] I see.

[00:29:26] Yeah, trying to—I guess—maybe a layered approach would be good.

[00:29:28] Um, but again, we don't want to create too much work for ourselves and the participants.

[00:29:35] And we don't want to create an overly complex process that's going to drag this out for longer than it needs to be.

[00:29:40] Because, as I said, most of this is: we put a block number in, uh, everything works.

[00:29:48] So, uh, dragging it out until the end of next year would be crazy.

[00:29:57] Uh—oops—lost—

[00:29:59] Do we have any idea the work that would be required to do the smoothing for 1559 in the core client?

[00:30:05] Maybe.

[00:30:13] Sorry, Diego. Could you repeat that?

[00:30:16] Oh, sorry. I—I—I missed Cody for—for a while, so I—I wasn't sure if it was me or it was him.

[00:30:24] I think maybe you cut out for a moment because I could hear him fully.

[00:30:28] Uh-huh. Okay.

[00:30:29] So, could you—do you know how much effort, development-wise, implementing 1120 would be?

[00:30:37] I believe that was Cody's question.

[00:30:46] Um,

[00:30:48] I think that the main problem is not implementing it, but, um, the testing part.

[00:30:53] That will be terrible because we have to simulate—I mean, we will probably have to emulate what Ethereum made for 1559.

[00:31:01] And that's something that we have to research.

[00:31:03] But, um, from what I remember, they kind of replayed most of their mainnet, um, like applying this mechanism.

[00:31:13] And they measured different scenarios on how that will work and how the curve will change and all that.

[00:31:21] So the first thing will be to, yeah, to dig in on how that was tested.

[00:31:29] Probably we could reach out to some of the people involved back at the time.

[00:31:31] I think they are still there and asking that, and yeah, then replicating it.

[00:31:40] Um, yeah, I think that will be the most crucial part, or time-consuming, and the most difficult one for one to head on how long it will take.

[00:31:51] Um, for the implementation itself, it's quite simple.

[00:31:54] Uh, it's pretty much the pseudocode, but it's in the ECIP.

[00:32:00] And I already implemented it on Besu, which is—uh—was quite simple.

[00:32:05] Uh, but I think the most difficult part is the other one.

[00:32:08] Um, yeah, and this will be a way different hard fork than previous ones.

[00:32:16] So I honestly think that thinking about March for having a testnet is a bit, um, ambitious.

[00:32:26] Why is this different from previous hard forks?

[00:32:29] Uh, because this will change the monetary policy, which is something that might affect—in ways that are not so easy to define up front.

[00:32:40] That's—that's the thing I most worry about.

[00:32:51] Sorry.

[00:32:52] How does this affect the monetary policy?

[00:32:55] Well, it's—it's not the monetary policy itself, sorry.

[00:32:58] It's—the—the fee mechanism.

[00:33:00] So it's a completely different thing.

[00:33:03] Right now it will be a different thing.

[00:33:07] It will be a different thing.

[00:33:09] I don't think that that impacts anything as far as timelines go.

[00:33:13] If we need to talk about it, I'll talk about it, but I'd love to understand the difficulty in implementing these things.

[00:33:23] Okay. Well, yeah, maybe it's, uh—yeah, maybe it's simpler than how it was in Ethereum because, well, they were burning things and we will not.

[00:33:36] So that might simplify a few things.

[00:33:38] But either way, I think it will be interesting to run at least some of the tests they ran.

[00:33:45] Yeah. No, I'm—I'm concerned that you're concerned, uh, is, I guess, what I would say.

[00:33:50] Uh, I think we should test.

[00:33:54] As I've been building out the Fukuii client, the Gorgoroth testnet has been for that—of making sure that all the clients talk, everything works together.

[00:34:01] And that I'm able to make sure all the parameters are tuned in right.

[00:34:07] So I definitely think that that's valuable.

[00:34:09] But I don't think that this takes longer than—

[00:34:15] Yeah, no. Something different from previous hard forks is that, basically, other hard forks have been already tested on Ethereum.

[00:34:24] And this we will not—at least not in the implementation that we are going through.

[00:34:29] And either way, it took us, like, a few months even when we were, like, three people working on this.

[00:34:36] Um, but, um, yeah, I think that's one of the main differences right now in this particular hard fork.

[00:34:43] Besides implementation itself, it will be something really unique.

[00:34:50] Okay, that makes sense.

[00:34:56] But, um, I still think we can still think, uh, for—for a timeline.

[00:35:02] Maybe not in this call, but it's good to have this in mind so we don't lose focus on what we are doing.

[00:35:07] And also, if we are lucky, we may have some extra hands—not so long in the future.

[00:35:18] Uh, but yeah, that could help us a lot on moving this forward.

[00:35:23] Yeah.

[00:35:26] I think it makes sense.

[00:35:29] And I think there's also some more questions about the treasury itself.

[00:35:33] I mean, 1111 and 1115 are just kind of proposals at this point.

[00:35:38] But there needs to be more clarity around how it would work in practice.

[00:35:42] So that also needs to be fleshed out.

[00:35:45] So, yeah.

[00:35:48] And that probably ties into this.

[00:35:51] So it makes sense.

[00:35:54] And I think the next question is, like, how do we get feedback from miners?

[00:35:59] Like, we talk about this stuff in Discord, but—

[00:36:02] And miners are not necessarily active there.

[00:36:06] And how do we reach out to them?

[00:36:10] Like, do we do, like, a survey or something?

[00:36:13] Or do we try to get some pool operators on a call?

[00:36:17] Or something like that?

[00:36:20] Because that's going to be important.

[00:36:23] Because at the end of the day, if miners don't like it, they can just—

[00:36:27] They can just not mine it.

[00:36:30] And then we have a chain split or whatever.

[00:36:33] So that's something we need to think about.

[00:36:37] Yeah, we definitely need miner input.

[00:36:41] I mean, the pools are the ones that control a lot of the signaling.

[00:36:46] And they also have incentives.

[00:36:50] So it would be good to get their perspective.

[00:36:53] But it's also tricky, because some pools are anonymous.

[00:36:57] And some are more public.

[00:37:00] And some have different agendas.

[00:37:04] So it's not straightforward.

[00:37:08] But yeah, that's definitely something we need to figure out.

[00:37:12] Another thought is, like, exchanges.

[00:37:15] Like, exchanges also have a stake in this.

[00:37:18] They have to decide which chain to support if there is a split.

[00:37:23] So maybe reaching out to them early is also important.

[00:37:27] But again, that's a lot of coordination.

[00:37:31] And we need to be careful not to overcomplicate it.

[00:37:35] Because, like we said, most of the technical work is not that hard.

[00:37:39] It's the social coordination that's hard.

[00:37:43] And that's always the case with these things.

[00:37:47] So we need to find a balance.

[00:37:50] But yeah, I agree we need to start thinking about this now, not later.

[00:37:56] Because otherwise, we'll just keep talking and not making progress.

[00:38:02] And then it will drag on forever.

[00:38:06] Which is not good.

[00:38:09] So, yeah.

[00:38:12] We should probably come up with some concrete next steps.

[00:38:17] Even if it's just, like, "let's reach out to X and Y and see what they think."

[00:38:22] That would be a start.

[00:38:26] Yeah.

[00:38:28] I agree.

[00:38:30] And we can also document this somewhere.

[00:38:34] Like, have a page that explains the options and the trade-offs.

[00:38:38] So people can read and make up their minds.

[00:38:42] Instead of just reacting to rumors.

[00:38:45] Because that's also part of the problem.

[00:38:48] People hear "treasury" and freak out.

[00:38:52] Without understanding the details.

[00:38:55] So better documentation would help.

[00:38:58] And that ties back to the editorial guidelines we mentioned earlier.

[00:39:02] About how we present this stuff on ethereumclassic.org.

[00:39:06] And making sure it's clear what's decided and what's still open.

[00:39:11] So, yeah,

[00:39:55] So, uh, the next topic was about editorial guidelines for ethereumclassic.org and this new Ethereum Classic community website.

[00:40:04] And this kind of ties into what we were just talking about, which is how things are framed publicly.

[00:40:12] Right now, there's a bit of a mismatch between what is being discussed internally and how it's being presented externally.

[00:40:21] And I think that can cause confusion and unnecessary conflict.

[00:40:27] So the idea here is not to censor anything or control narratives, but to have some basic guidelines around clarity and disclaimers.

[00:40:38] For example, making it clear when something is a proposal versus when it's an accepted or scheduled change.

[00:40:46] And making it clear when opinions are being expressed versus official documentation.

[00:40:54] I think this is especially important given how small misunderstandings can spiral on social media and Discord.

[00:41:04] So one suggestion is to have a standard disclaimer on pages related to ECIPs or upgrades that says something like, “This is a proposal and not finalized.”

[00:41:16] And similarly, for blog posts or announcements, to be explicit about the status of what’s being discussed.

[00:41:25] This would help readers who are not deeply involved in the process understand what’s actually happening.

[00:41:34] And it would also protect contributors from accusations of “pushing agendas” when they’re really just documenting ongoing work.

[00:41:45] Yeah, I think that makes sense.

[00:41:48] Especially because a lot of people don’t read ECIPs directly.

[00:41:52] They just see headlines or tweets.

[00:41:56] So the framing matters a lot.

[00:42:00] And having consistent language would help.

[00:42:04] I also think we should be careful about who is speaking “for” Ethereum Classic.

[00:42:09] Like, there’s a difference between “this is what I think” and “this is what Ethereum Classic will do.”

[00:42:16] And that line sometimes gets blurred.

[00:42:20] So guidelines could help there too.

[00:42:24] Agreed.

[00:42:27] And to be clear, this isn’t about stopping people from sharing ideas.

[00:42:31] It’s about making sure readers understand the context.

[00:42:36] Because otherwise, we end up with people arguing past each other.

[00:42:40] And that’s not productive.

[00:42:44] So maybe we can draft something lightweight.

[00:42:48] Not a huge policy document.

[00:42:51] Just some bullet points or a template.

[00:42:55] That contributors can follow.

[00:42:58] And then we can iterate on it.

[00:43:02] Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

[00:43:05] We don’t want to over-engineer it.

[00:43:08] But having nothing at all is also not great.

[00:43:12] So a middle ground is good.

[00:43:16] Okay.

[00:43:18] Is there anyone who wants to take a first pass at drafting something like that?

[00:43:24] Or should we just open an issue and collect ideas?

[00:43:28] I’m happy to open an issue.

[00:43:31] And maybe sketch an initial outline.

[00:43:35] And then people can comment.

[00:43:38] That way it’s transparent.

[00:43:42] And no one feels like it’s being imposed from above.

[00:43:46] Sounds good.

[00:43:48] Let’s do that.

[00:43:51] Okay.

[00:43:53] Anything else on this topic?

[00:43:56] No?

[00:43:58] All right.

[00:44:00] I think that covers the main agenda items.

[00:44:04] Is there any other business before we wrap up?

[00:44:08] No?

[00:44:10] Okay.

[00:44:12] Thanks everyone for joining.

[00:44:15] And we’ll see you on the next call.
