[00:00:00] Hey, so hello and welcome to Ethereum Classic Community Call number 44.

[00:00:03] Today is Friday, December 19th, 2025.

[00:00:06] This community call is an open voice chat discussion about Ethereum Classic.

[00:00:10] Everyone is welcome. Please be excellent to each other.

[00:00:12] The call will be published on YouTube, and if you're interested, you can join the call one hour before in the green room.

[00:00:19] This is a pre‑call hangout that will not be recorded. You can find us in the Discord voice channels.

[00:00:27] This week we have an announcement to make, which is a new community calls website, which you can find at cc.ethereumclassic.org.

[00:00:34] On this website you can browse all the past episodes. You can subscribe to the calendar or RSS feed to never miss a call.

[00:00:40] It has a time‑zone converter so you can ensure that you're arriving at the right time, and you can find AI summaries of all the calls. There will be more features to come.

[00:00:54] So, without further ado, let's dive in.

[00:00:57] There are three topics.

[00:01:01] Oh, I see Diego has his hand up. Would you like to chat, or was that just a clap?

[00:01:07] >> Yeah, no, it was just a clap for your great work on the website.

[00:01:12] >> Okay. Thanks, Diego. It was made with the help of Claude Code CLI, so I'd like to thank all the LLM producers out there that helped.

[00:01:23] So there are three topics we can dive into today, in no particular order.

[00:01:28] First, we have an approval deadlock on some merges happening across various Ethereum Classic repositories.

[00:01:35] Second, there are some remaining questions about Olympia that were brought up in the last call that I was hoping some of the authors might be able to address on this call.

[00:01:58] And finally, some potential discussion about editorial guidelines for ethereumclassic.org and this new Ethereum Classic community website.

[00:02:13] Is there anyone on the call who would like to jump in on any other topic, or any particular topic that I've brought up?

[00:02:28] Okay. In that case, I think we should jump into the first approval deadlock issue.

[00:02:34] I'm referring particularly to a comment made by Cody about trying to sort out the merge for ECIP‑1120, which was authored by me and Diego.

[00:02:49] It was submitted as a pull request to the ECIPs repository about two weeks ago and has since been in approval purgatory, trying to appease one of the ECIP maintainers.

[00:03:06] It seems, Cody, that this is okay with you. Do you have any ideas on next steps to get this unblocked?

[00:03:20] >> Yeah. I think for next steps, updating the editors in the ECIP repository is probably the right move.

[00:03:28] The process is intended to get as much information out in front of people as possible so they can read, think, and debate.

[00:03:41] Filibustering it doesn't really help anyone.

[00:03:48] MeowBits is still the other maintainer or editor, so we need to refresh that anyway.

[00:03:58] >> Okay. I saw that you recently made a pull request to update the list of editors, and I approved and merged that one.

[00:04:07] This would rotate inactive editors. That's PR‑549.

[00:04:14] I think you switched MeowBits out and added Diego to the list of maintainers. Has that been reflected in the teams as well, or is it just in the ECIP repository?

[00:04:29] That's a good question. Let me check.

[00:04:41] >> Will, would you mind sharing the link to this PR in the chat?

[00:04:47] >> Yep, no problem. I'll send it through in just a sec.

[00:05:09] >> Oh, no — I meant the other one. The one adding me as an editor.

[00:05:22] Let's see.

[00:05:29] All right, I will share that in just a second.

[00:05:37] It's number 549. Sorry.

[00:05:48] Okay. Do you see that?

[00:05:52] >> Yeah. Thank you.

[00:06:00] >> Just for the record, I want to make sure I'm not going insane — my interpretation of ECIP categorization is that Standards Track / Core is appropriate for ECIP‑1120.

[00:06:23] As far as I can tell.

[00:06:34] >> Yeah, I agree with that.

[00:06:39] Cool.

[00:06:39] I think if we have majority support to merge this, and there are no blockers, we can proceed.

[00:06:48] Chris was invited to the call, and I was hoping he'd join to give his interpretation, but he's not here at the moment.

[00:07:01] With three out of four maintainers supporting this, we can go ahead and merge it, even if that means dismissing a stale review.

[00:07:16] If anyone is against that, please let me know.

[00:07:28] Okay. So ECIP‑1120 can go ahead and be merged.

[00:07:31] There's also a side issue with ECIP WIP (Work in Progress) status.

[00:07:44] In ECIP‑1000, WIP is listed as optional for early‑stage ECIPs.

[00:07:59] Chris suggested using WIP status for 1120 at some point, and I was okay with that.

[00:08:08] However, the ECIP validator Ruby gem maintained by MeowBits does not support WIP and fails the build.

[00:08:27] I have another open pull request that removes this external dependency and runs validation locally in the ECIP repo.

[00:08:43] I'd request review from maintainers on that PR as well.

[00:08:58] >> Makes sense. What's the difference between WIP and Draft?

[00:09:07] >> The only mention in ECIP‑1000 is that very early‑stage drafts may be marked WIP.

[00:09:25] It seems the WIP clause was added later without updating the validator.

[00:09:38] The workaround so far has been prefixing titles with WIP.

[00:09:48] >> That's one option, but having an actual WIP status would be nicer.

[00:09:53] >> Yeah, having it internal would be preferred.

[00:09:59] >> I'm not a Ruby expert. The PR is co‑authored by AI agents. It works in testing, but I'd appreciate a sanity check.

[00:10:30] >> Cool.

[00:10:33] Diego, you should now have an invite to the ECIP editors team.

[00:10:40] Thank you.

[00:10:51] If Diego could approve 1120, that would help for the record.

[00:11:10] >> Are you going to change the status to WIP, or keep it Draft?

[00:11:19] This leads nicely into the next agenda item.

[00:11:25] I also made a PR to fix the Olympia ECIPs categorization to Standards Track / Core, since they implement hard forks.

[00:11:49] They currently use WIP prefixes as a workaround.

[00:12:03] I wanted to align 1120 and Olympia since both have unfixed parameters requiring further research.

[00:12:35] I'm fine with either WIP or Draft.

[00:12:48] Honestly, I think Draft is fine since the remaining changes are mostly parameter finalization.

[00:13:06] I do think the Standards Track type should be updated for Olympia ECIPs 1111 and 1112.

[00:13:18] I'm happy to remove the WIP prefix and keep both as Draft.

[00:13:28] >> I don't have any objection.

[00:13:32] >> Cool. I'll update my branch accordingly.

[00:13:56] >> What about 1121? I submitted a PR for that as well.

[00:14:06] >> It's an omnibus for things we've missed.

[00:14:16] Whatever the next hard fork is called, I'm fine with it.

[00:14:23] My concern is Olympia being promoted as a treasury.

[00:14:48] We need to clearly distinguish Olympia the hard fork from Olympia the treasury concept.

[00:15:13] >> Yeah, fair. Go ahead, Diego.

[00:15:21] >> I agree. Searching for Olympia brings up treasury articles.

[00:15:46] It would be better to use a different name if the next fork doesn't include the treasury.

[00:16:12] >> I like the Olympia name. It's already out there.

[00:16:31] We can clarify that a treasury is optional.

[00:17:12] I just want to call it Olympia and argue about what's inside later.

[00:17:21] If that's the way forward, I'm open to it.

[00:17:36] Undoing earlier messaging shouldn't be too difficult.

[00:18:22] We just need to clearly state that treasury inclusion is still debated.

[00:19:03] >> To me, the name isn't the blocker — implementation is.

[00:19:18] >> Exactly.

[00:19:22] Maybe the Olympia developer series can include 1120 as well.

[00:19:30] Either way, 1559 and smoothing are coming.

[00:19:51] >> Smoothing can be implemented in multiple ways.

[00:20:22] >> How are they different again?

[00:20:25] >> In 1115, smoothing is implemented via a smart contract.

[00:21:11] In 1120, it's protocol‑level and stateless.

[00:21:40] >> Got it.

[00:22:08] >> 1111 sends all base fee to treasury.

[00:22:10] 1120 smooths base fee to miners.

[00:22:13] 1115 is a middle ground.

[00:22:18] >> Do you advocate one over the other?

[00:22:33] >> Protocol‑level with optional treasury.

[00:22:48] >> Then 1115 should be updated.

[00:22:57] All require further testing and modeling.

[00:23:14] Most other ECIPs are already implemented in Besu and Core‑Geth.

[00:23:34] Olympia also needs sign‑off from Chris Mercer.

[00:24:06] >> Can we talk timelines?

[00:24:15] Reaching consensus is the main challenge.

[00:24:52] Implementation itself isn't the bottleneck.

[00:25:50] >> The controversial part is 1559 handling.

[00:26:12] Testnet by March is possible, mainnet by June.

[00:26:30] >> Miner signaling exists, but it's limited.

[00:26:49] A prediction market could add skin in the game.

[00:27:36] Locking coins changes incentives.

[00:28:08] >> But we shouldn't over‑burden participants.

[00:29:01] >> Pools control gas limits.

[00:29:31] >> We need to avoid overly complex processes.

[00:30:01] >> How much work is required for smoothing?

[00:30:48] >> Implementation is simple. Testing is hard.

[00:31:16] Replaying Ethereum tests may be necessary.

[00:32:16] This is a very different hard fork.

[00:32:29] >> Why is it different?

[00:32:55] >> It's the fee mechanism, not monetary policy.

[00:33:36] >> Testing still matters.

[00:34:09] >> Gorgoroth testnet helps tune parameters.

[00:34:24] >> Ethereum didn't test this exact model.

[00:35:11] Extra contributors could help.

[00:35:29] ECIP‑1120.dev research outlines test needs.

[00:36:26] Reorg handling and curve length need research.

[00:36:56] >> Can we have a go/no‑go by March 1st?

[00:37:15] >> I'm willing to contribute to research.

[00:38:00] 128‑block lookback may be sufficient.

[00:38:46] >> Larger windows reduce gaming.

[00:39:18] >> Mining pools already use smoothing.

[00:40:23] >> Linear vs decay curves need analysis.

[00:41:25] Precision allows flexibility.

[00:41:44] Coinbase recipient handling matters.

[00:42:12] >> Explorers may need adjustments.

[00:42:42] No opcode exposes block reward.

[00:43:50] Explorers are the main downstream impact.

[00:44:08] >> How do type‑1 and type‑2 txs interact?

[00:44:31] >> Same as Ethereum.

[00:45:12] Block reward calculation changes.

[00:46:04] Uncle rewards remain complex.

[00:46:33] Incentives remain mostly unchanged.

[00:47:31] Competitive blocks remain rewarded.

[00:48:28] Orphan handling needs care.

[00:49:04] We could contact original EIP‑1559 authors.

[00:49:25] Hassu might be interested.

[00:50:14] >> Plan: research, decide by March.

[00:50:33] >> Sounds good.

[00:50:41] >> Happy to help organize research.

[00:50:59] 2026 should be more exciting.

[00:51:15] Editorial guidelines are minor.

[00:51:44] Open to PRs and safeguards.

[00:52:16] >> Is the ambassador program active?

[00:52:31] >> Yes, mainly Twitter promotion.

[00:52:45] Articles are possible.

[00:53:11] Guidelines would help community involvement.

[00:53:37] Ambassador program overview given.

[00:54:23] Engagement earns rewards.

[00:54:36] Website helps call visibility.

[00:55:16] Future features could include NFTs and participation proofs.

[00:55:44] Hopefully Chris joins future calls.

[00:56:05] 2026 outlook is strong.

[00:56:17] Custody platform outreach continues.

[00:57:10] Institutional adoption is a priority.

[00:57:34] Cross‑chain interoperability is another focus.

[00:58:22] >> Exciting developments ahead.

[00:59:00] Increased contribution planned.

[00:59:21] Wrapping up.

[00:59:40] >> Thank you, everyone.

[00:59:56] This was the last community call of 2025. See you in 2026.

[01:00:02] Take care. Bye‑bye.
