## Let's Dive In

Three Topics.

### Approval Deadlock

- ECIP-1120 needs a merge path. [See discussion](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/547#issuecomment-3658937863).
- Other pending PRs include ECIP validation and Olympia WIP status change.


### Olympia Questions Remaining

- ECIP-1113 was not discussed last time. Questions [remain](https://github.com/orgs/ethereumclassic/discussions/530#discussioncomment-15042668) from the last call.
- ECIP-1120 is still not merged.
- Should we use the name "Olympia" [for a non-Treasury fork](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/554#discussion_r2633461167)?

### Editorial Guidelines for ETC.org

- How should we handle the [debate article](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/pull/1658)?
- Should ECIP-1559 articles have disclaimers?
- Is there bias in the Community Call [AI summaries](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/community-calls/issues/33)?
