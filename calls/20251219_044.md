## Let's Dive In

Three Topics.

### Approval Deadlock

- ECIP-1120 needs a merge path. [See discussion](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/547#issuecomment-3658937863).
- Other pending PRs include ECIP validation and Olympia WIP status change.


### Olympia Questions Remaining

- ECIP-1113 was not discussed last time. Questions [remain](https://github.com/orgs/ethereumclassic/discussions/530#discussioncomment-15042668) from the last call.
- ECIP-1120 is still not merged.
- Should we use the name "Olympia" [for a non-Treasury fork](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/554#discussion_r2633461167)?

### Editorial Guidelines for ETC.org

- How should we handle the [debate article](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/pull/1658)?
- Should ECIP-1559 articles have disclaimers?
- Is there bias in the Community Call [AI summaries](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/community-calls/issues/33)?

## Key takeaways

- ECIP1120 will be merged after receiving approval from multiple maintainers
- A decision was made to implement local validation for the ECIP repository instead of relying on external Ruby gems
- March 2026 was set as a target date for making a go/no-go decision on implementing EIP-1559 with smoothing
- Research is needed to determine parameters for the smoothing mechanism, with 128 blocks being considered as a starting point
- The Olympia name will continue to be used for the next hard fork, with clarification needed about whether it will include a treasury
## Discussed topics

### ECIP approval deadlock

Discussion about resolving the approval deadlock for ECIP1120 and other pull requests
- **Details**
    - **Istora**: Raised concern about ECIP1120 being in "approval purgatory" for two weeks
    - **Cody**: Suggested updating the editors in the ECIP repos as the next step, noting that "filibustering doesn't help anyone"
    - **Diego**: Requested links to the relevant pull requests
    - **Istora**: Confirmed that with 3 out of 4 maintainers supporting the merge, they could proceed even with a stale review
- **Conclusion**
    - Agreement to merge ECIP1120 with majority support from maintainers
    - Pull request #549 was approved to update the list of editors, adding Diego as a maintainer
### ECIP validation improvements

Discussion about improving the validation process for ECIPs
- **Details**
    - **Istora**: Explained issues with the WIP (Work in Progress) status in ECIPs and how the external Ruby gem validator doesn't support it
    - **Istora**: Created a pull request to change the logic so validation runs locally within the ECIP repo
    - **Cody**: Agreed that having internal validation control is preferred
- **Conclusion**
    - The pull request to implement local validation will be reviewed and likely merged
    - This will allow proper use of the WIP status for ECIPs
### Olympia hard fork naming and contents

Discussion about the name and contents of the next hard fork
- **Details**
    - **Istora**: Expressed concern that "Olympia" has been promoted as a treasury implementation
    - **Diego**: Noted that searching for "Olympia" and "Ethereum Classic" brings up articles about the treasury
    - **Cody**: Preferred keeping the Olympia name since it's been used for a year, suggesting clarification that treasury is optional
    - **Istora**: Agreed to proceed with the name if proper messaging clarifies that Olympia may not include a treasury
- **Conclusion**
    - The Olympia name will continue to be used for the next hard fork
    - Clear communication is needed to separate the Olympia name from the treasury implementation
### EIP-1559 implementation research

Detailed discussion about implementing EIP-1559 with smoothing mechanism
- **Details**
    - **Cody**: Asked about the work required to implement smoothing for 1559 in the CorGeth client
    - **Diego**: Explained that implementation is relatively simple but testing would be challenging, requiring simulation of different scenarios
    - **Istora**: Noted that research is needed on parameters like the number of blocks for smoothing
    - **Diego**: Suggested 128 blocks might be optimal as clients already need to keep this many blocks in memory
    - **Cody**: Compared the smoothing to mining pool payout algorithms
- **Conclusion**
    - Research is needed on the optimal number of blocks for smoothing (128 blocks as starting point)
    - Additional research needed on handling OMERs (uncle blocks) with the new mechanism
    - Blockchain explorers would need to update their reward calculation algorithms
### Timeline for next hard fork

Discussion about setting a timeline for the next hard fork
- **Details**
    - **Cody**: Proposed having a go/no-go decision by March 1st, 2026
    - **Diego**: Cautioned that March might be ambitious for testnet implementation
    - **Cody**: Suggested that if 1559 implementation isn't ready, other ECIPs could still be activated by June 1st
    - **Diego**: Agreed with the timeline approach but emphasized the need for thorough testing
- **Conclusion**
    - March 2026 set as target for deciding whether to include 1559 in the hard fork
    - June 2026 as potential mainnet activation date
### Community Call website and editorial guidelines

Brief discussion about the new Community Call website
- **Details**
    - **Istora**: Announced the new community call website at [cc.ethereumclassic.org](https://cc.ethereumclassic.org)
    - **Istora**: Mentioned features including browsing past episodes, calendar subscription, time zone converter, and AI summaries
    - **Diego**: Expressed appreciation for the website work
- **Conclusion**
    - The website will continue to be maintained and potentially expanded with new features
### ETC Ambassador Program

Brief discussion about the Ambassador program
- **Details**
    - **Cody**: Asked if the Ambassador program was still active
    - **Phil**: Confirmed the program is active, funded by ETC Grants DAO, with ambassadors promoting ETC on Twitter
    - **Phil**: Explained that ambassadors receive rewards based on engagement metrics
- **Conclusion**
    - The Ambassador program could potentially contribute articles to the website in the future
### Future plans for Ethereum Classic

Discussion about plans for Ethereum Classic in 2026
- **Details**
    - **Cody**: Mentioned working on getting ETC listed on more custody platforms used by institutions and banks
    - **Cody**: Highlighted cross-chain interoperability as a priority for 2026
    - **Istora**: Expressed excitement about upcoming developments in the wider EVM ecosystem
- **Conclusion**
    - 2026 is expected to be an active year for Ethereum Classic development
    - Focus will be on institutional adoption and cross-chain interoperability
