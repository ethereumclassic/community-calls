3 Topics. 

- Freebird's Funding Comments
- Research Next Steps
- Consensus & Signaling

### Freebird Comments

Critical software funds are running dry. ETC Coop is selling ETC at rock bottom prices each quarter. Verify here https://etccooperative.org/filings

+ Mar 14, 2025: `As of December 31, 2024, the Coop has $0.4M in USD and $1.7M in ETC at Market Value. However, the crypto markets lack stability and as of February 2025, that has been fluctuating between $1.7M- $1.0M. Without any way to obtain funding, the ETC Coop will be in maintenance mode, with spending minimized, until the funding runs out. At that time, it will be up to other stakeholders to take on any required maintenance of the ETC client, unless a new plan materializes. ` ~ ETC Cooperative, 2024 Retrospective Report (page 25)

+ Jun 24th, 2025: `As of March 31, 2025, the ETC Coop had 67,400 ETC tokens in its custody account. The market value at March 31, 2024 was $1,131,407. The ETC Cooperative will not be sustainable in the future, without new sponsors or a significant increase in the market value of the ETC tokens held.` ~ ETC Cooperative, 2025 Q1 Report (page 14)

+ Sep 1, 2025: `As of June 30, 2025, the ETC Coop had 63,385 ETC tokens in its custody account. The market value at June 30, 2025 was $1,050,000. During the quarter, 3000 ETC tokens were swapped for USD for regular operating cash-flows. The ETC Cooperative will not be sustainable in the future, without new sponsors or a significant increase in the market value of the ETC tokens held.` ~ ETC Cooperative, 2025 Q2 Report (page 8)

+ Dec 15, 2025: `As of September 30, 2025, the ETC Coop had 60,085 ETC tokens in its custody account. The market value at September 30, 2025 was $1.16M. During the quarter, 3300 ETC tokens were swapped for USD for regular operating cash-flows. We are currently redeeming about one month of expenses per month. However, since the date of this report the ETC price has been declining significantly. The ETC Cooperative will not be sustainable in the future, without new sponsors. ` ~ ETC Cooperative, 2025 Q3 Report (page 8)

Putting a real issue on the table for discussion (same topic raised in Q1 2025).

Based on public filings, ETC core client maintenance funding is trending toward exhaustion within ~12 months. Bitmain stepping in to fund a couple of dev roles helps short-term, but it also highlights a recurring pattern: teams run out of runway, external sponsors bridge it temporarily, and then the cycle repeats.

For folks here with experience in PoW networks, infra, or client maintenance: **what actually prevents this from recurring long-term?**

Concretely, the risks I’m watching are operational, not theoretical:

* Client maintenance slows/stalls (consensus/EVM compatibility risk over time)
* Public RPC availability degrades (ecosystem usability + reliability)
* Explorer/indexing funding degrades (basic transparency + dev tooling)
* If infra and maintenance slip, exchanges/miners/users feel it first via liquidity + integration friction

How do other networks keep core maintenance and critical infra predictable and sustainable **without** becoming permanently dependent on a single sponsor?

### Research Plan

Regardless of whether a Treasury happens or not, there are important research tasks to complete.

- Research needed: optimal smoothing parameters (128 blocks as starting point?)
- OMER (uncle block) handling with the new mechanism
- Testing strategy and testnet deployment
- March 2026 go/no-go decision timeline still on track?

### Consensus & Signaling: Lessons from Bitcoin

[ECIP-1022](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1022), authored by Wei Tang, proposed a decentralized voting mechanism for ETC consensus changes, specifically for contentious hard forks, adapted from Bitcoin's BIP-9/BIP-135. Instead of hard-coding block numbers for forks, miners signal support by setting bits in each block's extraData field. When enough blocks signal support (meeting a threshold within a measurement window), the fork "locks in" and activates after a grace period. This allows forks to progress through states: DEFINED → STARTED → LOCKED_IN → ACTIVE (or FAILED).

- Bitcoin's experience: BIP-9 gave miners veto power, leading to BIP-8 and "Speedy Trial" alternatives
- MASF (Miner Activated) vs. UASF (User Activated) soft forks
- How should ETC coordinate consensus changes? Flag day? Miner signaling? Hybrid?
- What role should miners, node operators, and stakeholders each play?

### Bonus 1: What's Next for ETC?

- Prediction markets and other new applications coming to ETC
- What else should we be building or exploring?
- Open floor for ideas and discussion

### Bonus 2: Quantifying ETC's Distribution

- Market cap is a poor metric for value - what fundamentals actually matter?
- How distributed is ETC compared to other chains? Can we measure this?
- Fair launch history: no premine, no ICO, organic distribution since 2016
- Research idea: analyze on-chain distribution metrics (Gini coefficient, top holder concentration, etc.)
