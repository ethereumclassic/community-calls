## Let's Dive In

3 Topics.

### ECIP-1120: Research Plan

- ECIP-1120 has been merged. What's next? See [ecip1120.dev](https://ecip1120.dev) for details.
- Research needed: optimal smoothing parameters (128 blocks as starting point?)
- OMER (uncle block) handling with the new mechanism
- Testing strategy and testnet deployment
- March 2026 go/no-go decision timeline still on track?

### Consensus & Signaling: Lessons from Bitcoin

[ECIP-1022](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1022), authored by Wei Tang, proposed a decentralized voting mechanism for ETC consensus changes, specifically for contentious hard forks, adapted from Bitcoin's BIP-9/BIP-135. Instead of hard-coding block numbers for forks, miners signal support by setting bits in each block's extraData field. When enough blocks signal support (meeting a threshold within a measurement window), the fork "locks in" and activates after a grace period. This allows forks to progress through states: DEFINED → STARTED → LOCKED_IN → ACTIVE (or FAILED).

- Bitcoin's experience: BIP-9 gave miners veto power, leading to BIP-8 and "Speedy Trial" alternatives
- MASF (Miner Activated) vs. UASF (User Activated) soft forks
- How should ETC coordinate consensus changes? Flag day? Miner signaling? Hybrid?
- What role should miners, node operators, and stakeholders each play?

### What's Next for ETC?

- Prediction markets and other new applications coming to ETC
- What else should we be building or exploring?
- Open floor for ideas and discussion

### Bonus: Quantifying ETC's Distribution

- Market cap is a poor metric for value - what fundamentals actually matter?
- How distributed is ETC compared to other chains? Can we measure this?
- Fair launch history: no premine, no ICO, organic distribution since 2016
- Research idea: analyze on-chain distribution metrics (Gini coefficient, top holder concentration, etc.)
