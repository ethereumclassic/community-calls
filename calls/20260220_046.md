## Last Call Recap

- Cody noted that most ECIP-1121 changes are already in CoreGeth from upstream merges
- Consensus: ECIP-1121 is a "low effort win" that can proceed independently of ECIP-1120 research
- Multiple client implementations would enhance validation
- AI-assisted development could help non-specialized devs create implementations for expert review
- EIP-7825 (transaction gas limit cap) helps prevent DoS attacks; aligns well with ETC's 8M block gas limit
- BLS12-381 curves (EIP-2537) enable ZK proofs and BLS signature verification on-chain
- EIP-7951 (secp256r1 precompile) enables account abstraction beyond EOAs
- Blob-related EIPs are deferred pending future decisions

## Let's Dive In

- Push 1559 to a later date and focus on 1121?
- March 2026 go/no-go decision timeline for 1559
- Research plan for ECIP-1120 mechanisms
- Let's scrutinize every EIP.
