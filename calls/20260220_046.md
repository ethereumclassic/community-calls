## Preamble

Hello, and Welcome!

This community call is an open voice chat discussion about Ethereum Classic. Everyone is welcome. Please be excellent to each other.

The call will be published on YouTube.

You can browse all past episodes at https://cc.ethereumclassic.org. Subscribe to the Calendar or RSS to never miss a call. It has a handy timezone converter. You can find AI Summaries of all the calls.

## Announcements

### New Call Time

**Going forward, community calls will be held at this new time (02:00 UTC).** This schedule better accommodates recent active participants and reduces the scheduling burden. For US participants, this is Thursday evening; for Asia, Friday morning. Sorry Europe!

### Green Room Moving to Zoom

The pre-call Green Room will now be on Zoom instead of Discord. This simplifies the setup and allows participants from China to join, as Discord is blocked there.

### Devcon 8 Mumbai

[Devcon 8](https://devcon.org/en/) is coming to Mumbai, India, November 3–6, 2026. Could be a great opportunity to organize an ETC side event. Any community members planning to attend?

### Discord Face ID Requirement

Discord is now requiring Face ID verification. Discussion about implications for the ETC community Discord.

### InArgentumVeritas: Web3 Chat & Poker App

Discord user InArgentumVeritas shared a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XatE1qVrbrg) of their web3 chat app with a poker game, available at [chat.inargentumveritas.app](https://chat.inargentumveritas.app/).

## Last Call Recap

Consensus that ECIP-1121 is a low-effort win that can proceed independently of ECIP-1120 research, with most changes already in CoreGeth from upstream.

## Let's Dive In

- Olympia governance bootstrap — community feedback and miner representation
- ETC Nexus — open source testing project and ECIP-1121 validation plans
- ECIP-1121 deep dive — review each EIP and next steps for the next hard fork

### Olympia Community Feedback

romainblachier-eng [responded](https://github.com/orgs/ethereumclassic/discussions/530#discussioncomment-15846413) to the five bootstrap governance questions with agreement, and raised concerns about early governance dominance by large holders, miner representation given their capital commitment, and the communication gap left by the Cooperative's reduced capacity.

- How should miner interests be represented in the governance bootstrap?
- What anti-Sybil and fair-distribution mechanisms address these concerns?

### ETC Nexus Testing Project

[ETC Nexus](https://github.com/IstoraMandiri/etc-nexus) is now public. It's a workspace for developing and testing Ethereum Classic protocol changes using the Ethereum Hive testing framework, with a focus on AI-assisted development. It submodules Hive and ETC clients (core-geth, besu-etc, nethermind-etc) so that an agent can implement protocol changes, create test cases, run tests, and iterate. A full 3-client consensus test run validated 183,985 tests at a 99.84% pass rate across 9 ETC-compatible forks (Frontier through Berlin).

Istora will use ETC Nexus to test ECIP-1121 implementation in core-geth and besu-etc before the next call.

### Main Topic: ECIP-1121 Deep Dive & Next Steps

A closer look at ECIP-1121 and what's needed to move it forward. Should this be the focus of the next ETC hard fork?

#### New Smart Contract Features

These give developers new tools to build with, making ETC compatible with modern Ethereum apps.

- **[EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153)** — Temporary scratch space for smart contracts that resets after each transaction, enabling cheaper DeFi operations
- **[EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656)** — New instruction for copying data within memory more efficiently, reducing gas costs
- **[EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780)** — Disables the ability for contracts to delete themselves, removing a long-standing security footgun
- **[EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)** — Lets regular wallets (EOAs) behave like smart contracts, unlocking features like transaction batching and gas sponsorship
- **[EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)** — Adds fast built-in cryptography for ZK proofs and BLS signatures, enabling privacy and advanced verification on-chain
- **[EIP-7951](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7951)** — Adds built-in support for the cryptography used by phones and hardware keys, enabling passkey-based wallets

#### Network Safety & Limits

These protect the network from abuse and keep block sizes manageable.

- **[EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623)** — Makes it more expensive to stuff blocks with calldata, reducing worst-case block sizes
- **[EIP-7825](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825)** — Hard cap on gas per transaction, preventing single transactions from hogging an entire block
- **[EIP-7883](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883)** — Corrects underpriced math operations that could be exploited for slow block processing
- **[EIP-7934](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934)** — Hard cap on block size at 10 MiB, preventing oversized blocks from slowing down the network
- **[EIP-7935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7935)** — Updates default gas limit recommendations for client software

#### Infrastructure & Tooling

Under-the-hood improvements for node operators, developers, and future scalability.

- **[EIP-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)** — Stores recent block hashes on-chain, a building block for future stateless clients
- **[EIP-7642](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642)** — Removes legacy bloom filters from receipts and defines a history serving window, reducing storage bloat
- **[EIP-7910](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7910)** — New RPC method so tools can programmatically query which fork rules are active

#### Deferred (blob-related, not applicable to ETC)

[EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788), [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-7516](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516), [EIP-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691), [EIP-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840), [EIP-7892](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892), [EIP-7918](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7918)

#### Next Steps

- Client implementation status: what's already in CoreGeth from upstream?
- What work is needed for besu-etc and nethermind-etc?
- Testing strategy: using ETC Nexus and Hive for validation
- Timeline and milestones for Mordor testnet deployment
- Go/no-go criteria and coordination

### Other Discussion

- ECIP-1120 research status and March 2026 go/no-go decision
- Open floor
